A quick-and-dirty profiling of PuffinPlot while stepping through a
suite of samples reveals the following breakdown of the event queue:

81% GraphDisplay.paint, which includes
60.5% DataTable.draw, which includes
44% TextLinePoint.<init>, which includes
27.5% TextLayout.<init> and
12.9% TextLayout.getBounds

DataTable.draw also spends 12.1% of time in String.format.

So there are huge time savings to be made if this can be improved in 
any way. A Big Dumb Cache is the obvious approach, but perhaps 
improvements can be made in the way the Java2D API is being used. If
caching is going the be done, would it be better to institute a 
more general system for caching whole Plots?
