This would be pretty easy to implement -- just fetch a baked-in
URL which gives the latest released version. Said URL should 
probably give a URL where latest version can be downloaded, in 
cae I have to switch hosts again. One problem is what to use
as a long-term host for the "latest version" URL. Perhaps a
PURL or similar? Then again, if the URL's not present we just 
skip the version check, so it's not a huge disaster if it has
to move.
