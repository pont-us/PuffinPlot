title: Implement both "save" and "save as..." actions
desc: |-
  PuffinPlot should follow the standard desktop application semantics of
  having a non-interactive "save" action when a filename is already defined,
  falling through to an interactive "save as..." for the first time a file
  is saved. Currently we have a "save as..." labelled as a "save", and nothing
  else.
