Last comment should have read: *FreeHEP* puts everything in one group
(and Batik creates bizarre subgroups). Also, on latest test, Batik
SVG export seems to produce an incorrect page size.

Another note: FreeHEP SVG seems about three times the size of equivalent
Batik SVG. Looking at source, this may be due to much larger (excessive?)
number of decimal places used for positions in FreeHEP output.
