title: Current sample / selected samples
desc: |-
  I think the manual's wrong about relationship between current
  and selected samples in discrete suites -- current is always
  first sample of selection, outline box does not show current and
  doesn't show at all in GTK+ LnF. I think the behaviour's OK
  (for now at least) so just update the documentation. Also check
  that long core current/selection is correctly documented.
