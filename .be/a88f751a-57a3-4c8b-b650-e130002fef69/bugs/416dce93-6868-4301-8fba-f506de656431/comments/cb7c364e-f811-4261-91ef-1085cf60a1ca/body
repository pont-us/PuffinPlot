Vec3 contains a number of static methods which operate on 
sequences of vectors. These would probably be better handled by
a new companion class which acts as a wrapper around an ordered
list of vectors and permits operations on them. This might also
make it easier to keep vector paths immutable, if this proves
to be a worthwhile endeavour.
