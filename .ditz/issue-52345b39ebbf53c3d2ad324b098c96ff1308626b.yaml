title: Update source/binary format to Java 1.7
desc: |-
  Java 6 is more or less at EOL, and there are some nice improvements
  in 1.7 which will help to clean the code up a bit (try/catch resource
  management etc.). As ever, OS X is the holdout, since pre-10.7 users
  can't easily install Java 7. However, these are down to ~20% of the
  OS X user base now (and falling), so it will soon become reasonable to
  drop support -- especially since those on old Macs can just keep using
  the old PuffinPlot.
