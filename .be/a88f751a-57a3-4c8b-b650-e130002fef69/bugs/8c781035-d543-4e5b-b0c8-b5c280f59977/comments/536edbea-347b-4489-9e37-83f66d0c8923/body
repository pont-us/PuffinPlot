It seems relatively common to have North on the positive Z axis
on a Zplot (see e.g. Dunlop 1979, Wilson and Roberts 1999). Dunlop
recommends making the x axis the intersection between the vertical
projection plane and the horizontal plane. Nobody's asked for this
at Otago but it seems common enough that I should implement it
before wider release.
