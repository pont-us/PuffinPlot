title: Check that tray correction is correct
desc: |-
  Is the tray correction being applied to the raw SQUID readings (before
  volume correction)? It should be.

    Also, is the correct run number being picked for the tray reading?
    -- that is, the most recent one before the datum for which the correction
    is needed. I see some odd behaviour when toggling the tray correction for
    the tray samples themselves.

    Tray corrections are applied after volume correction -- but since
    tray correction is only available for discrete samples, and since
    for discrete samples volume correction is the same in each axis,
    it makes no difference whether the tray correction is applied before
    or after it. The run number is no longer relevant since we've moved
    to a sequential model of tray corrections, with the tray measurement
    in the same file as the sample measurements.
