title: Remove empty-slot facilities
desc: |-
  Empty-slot corrections need to be rethought and reimplemented,
  and there's no time to do that for version 1.0. The best plan
  is to remove at least the menu items (to avoid confusing users)
  and probably the code too (since it's not currently used, and
  since it would probably need re-writing and testing before
  being useful); it'll be in the repo if I ever need it again 
  anyway.

    I've just removed the menu items, but left the underlying code.
    It's unlikely that tray corrections will become an on-the-fly item
    again (with all the complex measurement protocols I've introduced),
    but it's possible that a sensible implementation of the empty-slot
    correction would apply it on-the-fly. In that case, there's no
    reason not to let the user toggle it. So I'm leaving a code skeleton
    to allow that, for now.
