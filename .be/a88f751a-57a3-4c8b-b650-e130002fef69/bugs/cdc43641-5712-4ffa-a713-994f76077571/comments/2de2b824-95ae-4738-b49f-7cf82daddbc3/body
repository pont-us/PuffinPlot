Controlling whether it's applied to the formation correction 
probably sufficient -- after all, if you're not applying it
to *anything*, you can just set it to zero. And I suspect that
the case of wanting your formation correction corrected for
local magnetic declination, but not your sample correction,
is rare enough that I can ignore it.
