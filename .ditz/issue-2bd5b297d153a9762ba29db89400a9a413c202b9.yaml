title: Automatic update checking
desc: |-
  I waste a lot of time trying to verify bugs which have already been
  fixed. It would be good to have a mechanism whereby PP can check in
  at talvi.net whether there is a newer version, and exhort the user to
  upgrade if so (especially in the case of a crash).
