title: Proper plot scaling
desc: |-
  ALL plot elements (line widths, data-point sizes, axis ticks, etc.)
  need to be explicitly scaled to current resolution, so that e.g.
  high-resolution printouts don't get tiny data-points. Shouldn't be
  too hard now that the underlying graphics system makes less use of
  AffineTransforms.

    Fixed as specified. I suspect that a couple of unanticipated 
    consequences may eventuate but these can be opened as new, more
    sepcific bugs.
