Not entirely sure what this one alluded to (I'm transcribing it from the
old tdl bug-list) but I'm pretty sure it means "allow scaling of Z-plot
for whole suite rather than single sample". This allows for easier
side-by-side comparison of samples. Actually what's needed is scaling
according to a selected bunch of samples within a suite: you wouldn't be
publishing the graphs of the whole suite anyway, so you'd want to scale
according to exactly those samples you were publishing.
