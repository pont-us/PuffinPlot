title: Allow use of strike/dip and azimuth/hade
desc: "Anonymous reviewer says:\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98I do prefer to use dip direction and dip for bedding and other\n\
  planar attitudes- however this is not universally the case- so a\n\
  toggle option to use either strike and dip, or dip direction and\n\
  dip, would be useful. Likewise, our lab uses azimuth and hade,\n\
  rather than azimuth and plunge, for core orientation- so a toggle\n\
  for either of those formats would also be a good additional\n\
  feature.\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  Shouldn't be too hard."
