title: PuffinPlot does not read MD03_8_Nc.DAT correctly
desc: |-
  This is a 2G long core file from Leonardo Sagnotti. It is read
  as a discrete file with a single sample with the name UNKNOWN.
  The problem appears to be that there is no Depth column, the
  depth instead being given in the Position column.

    PuffinPlot now sets measurement type to Continuous if a file contains
    a Position field but no Sample ID field.
