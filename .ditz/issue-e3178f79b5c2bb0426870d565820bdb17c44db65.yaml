  is subsequently disabled (for both text and lines) in the main graph
  display.

  - "A very strange bug -- haven't figured out the cause yet. FreeHEP gets\n\
    its own Graphics2D object and I can't see how it could mess with the\n\
    rendering hints for the on-screen one. In any case, the rendering hints\n\
    by the paint() method on every redraw. Adding a\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98if (g instanceof SVGGraphics2D) return;\xE2\x80\x99 to the start of paint()\n\
    squashes the bug (but of course results in a blank SVG); this implies\n\
    that it's the actual process of drawing to the FreeHEP graphics object\n\
    which disables anti-aliasing, rather than anything peripheral in the\n\
    saveToSvgFreehep method."
