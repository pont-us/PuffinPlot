title: More options for Zplot axes
desc: |-
  It seems relatively common to have North on the positive Z axis
  on a Zplot (see e.g. Dunlop 1979, Wilson and Roberts 1999). Dunlop
  recommends making the x axis the intersection between the vertical
  projection plane and the horizontal plane. Nobody's asked for this
  at Otago but it seems common enough that I should implement it
  before wider release.

    This isn't particularly difficult, but due to severe time pressure
    for the 1.0 release, I'm going to defer it to 1.1

    Bumping up to 1.03 since someone's finally requested it.

    It would help visually if you lined up the common axes on the
    Zijderveld diagrams
