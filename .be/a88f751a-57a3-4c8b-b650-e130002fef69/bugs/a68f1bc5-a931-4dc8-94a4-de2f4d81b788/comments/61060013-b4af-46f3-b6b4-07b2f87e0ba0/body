PCA anchoring should be a sample property, since different samples
within the same suite can have demagnetization chaarcteristics
calling for either anchoring or no anchoring. Currently anchoring
is specified on PCA recalculation and must thus be explicitly specified
every time. This loses information when recalculating for a whole
batch of samples.
