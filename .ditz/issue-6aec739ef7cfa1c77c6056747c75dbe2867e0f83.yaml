    Have added a draft manual file to the repo to serve as an occasional
    brain-dump for things that need to be in the documentation.

    Would JavaHelp be the right thing to use for displaying the
    documentation? Could just do it in HTML and put it online, but users
    may want to read it offline.

    JavaHelp looks a little heavyweight -- even the jhbasic jar is ~400kB,
    around twice the size of PuffinPlot! What about writing docs in
    AsciiDoc or similar, putting HTML version online, and providing
    HTML and PDF versions for download?

    AsciiDoc looks promising actually -- can generate chunked HTML via
    DocBook. Processing will obviously be a bit heavyweight since it needs
    a DocBook toolchain, but output shouldn't be too big.

    With Batik now bundled, size is less of a concern for JavaHelp,
    and there is a full HTML manual produced using htlatex. The only 
    remaining thing is the work of actually integrating the JavaHelp
    classes, producing the JavaHelp files from the HTML, bundling
    them into the jar, and persuading JavaHelp to load them. JavaHelp
    seems to be fairly old, seldom used, and with limited documentation,
    so I'd estimate this at maybe 8-16 hours of work.
