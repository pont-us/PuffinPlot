title: Editable sites
desc: "Currently site codes are set purely by inference from\n\
  the sample name, assuming Otago naming conventions. If\n\
  PuffinPlot's going to be any use to anyone else, we need\n\
  the capability to set them explicitly! Should be pretty\n\
  simple. As well as a straight \xE2\x80\x98set this site code for the\n\
  selected samples\xE2\x80\x99 features, it would be good to have a\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98use this character range (from the sample name) as the\n\
  site code\xE2\x80\x99 function."

    Site names can now be set in three ways: explicitly and 
    individually per sample; from a substring of the sample's name;
    and (for long core samples) from the depth.
