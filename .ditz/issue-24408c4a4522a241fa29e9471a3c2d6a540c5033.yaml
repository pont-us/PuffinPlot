title: Site auto-grouping fails for Christian's numbering scheme
desc: |-
  Christian has a data-set where the sample codes don't include the
  dot between the core number and sample number. Thus site groupings
  are wrong, since PuffinPlot uses the last four characters as the 
  sample ID. PuffinPlot should check for presence of dot and act
  accordingly.

    Ideally I should add some kind of UI to allow manual grouping of
    samples into sites in cases where the scheme doesn't follow OPRF
    conventions.

    Site grouping now peels off last three digits of sample code if no
    dot is present, and the last four if there is a dot.
