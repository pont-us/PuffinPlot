title: Remove automatic site-guessing on loading
desc: |-
  Now that we have explicitly represented sites and the facilities
  for the user to set them, it's redundant to retain the old 
  guess-sites-on-loading code. It's also buggy: sample names that don't
  conform to the Otago template can cause Puffin to crash (for
  example, the single-character sample name x).
