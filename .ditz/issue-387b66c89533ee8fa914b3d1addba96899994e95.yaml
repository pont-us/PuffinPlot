title: Export both polarities in suite calculations
desc: "At present, \xE2\x80\x98export suite calculations\xE2\x80\x99 just seems to give\n\
  a single mean. If a site contains sites of both polarities,\n\
  it should give both normal and reversed means. Actually on\n\
  closer inspection it's worse: we're just exporting the fisher\n\
  mean of all the individual PCAs. This is certainly worth doing,\n\
  but we definitely also need meta-means of the site means.\n\
  (ISTR Opdyke & Channell has some discussion of which of the \n\
  techniques is superior but it's as well to do both and let\n\
  the user choose.)"

    The suite mean has been expanded to encompass six values:
    overall, upper-hemisphere, and lower-hemisphere for per-site and
    per-sample averages. They are all exported in the suite data
    CSV file.
