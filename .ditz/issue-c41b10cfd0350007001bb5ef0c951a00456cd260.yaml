    I think I've just accidentally reproduced this, or something like
    it. Create a site direction with an a95 region that crosses the 
    equator -- it just gets cut off straight rather than having the
    "other" part correctly projected! "Straight" here meaning a 
    straight line on-screen rather than on the sphere.
