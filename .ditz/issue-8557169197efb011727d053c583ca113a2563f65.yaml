title: Simultaneous treatment of fits with different corrections
desc: |-
  JMG writes:
  I was playing around today with outputs and was wondering if there was a
  way to customize it.  At present it only puts out sample and site
  directions in one coordinate system (I assume this is in stratigraphic
  coordinates??).  It would be good to output both geo and strat coords.
  
  Dealing with this would probably require some rearchitecting to
  store the different corrections simultaneously -- see also #247,
  multiple fits per sample. These two should probably be implemented
  simultaneously.
