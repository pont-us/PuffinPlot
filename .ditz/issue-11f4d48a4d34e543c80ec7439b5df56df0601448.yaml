title: Test superscript with latest Mac Java version
desc: "At present I employ a complex and unreliable hack to simulate\n\
  superscripts on Mac OS X, because when I last tested it, it had\n\
  terrible bugs in superscript rendering. Now that Java 6 has finally\n\
  been released for OS X, I should check whether \xE2\x80\x98proper\xE2\x80\x99 superscript\n\
  rendering works there. If I'm dropping support for Java 5 anyway,\n\
  I could dispense with the hack entirely."

    OK, seems that provided we have Java 6 on OS X 10.6, superscript
    rendering finally works. I've retested the workaround on 
    OS X 10.5.8 / Java 1.5 / PPC (works) and proper superscripting on
    OS X 10.6 / Java 1.6 / Intel (also works). PuffinPlot will
    now use proper superscripting on OS X provided that OS X >= 10.6
    and Java >= 1.6.
