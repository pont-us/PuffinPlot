This doesn't seem to be as important to people as I thought,
perhaps because they're better at munging their own data than I
suspected. Or perhaps everything they wanted really is in there
already. In any case I'm dropping it from 1.0 to 1.1 since import
flexibility is far more important and time is limited.
