Hard work but the rewards would be tremendous. A command console in the
running program to perform custom manipulations en masse. A headless
batch mode allowing PP to be incorporated into a publication build
script. Groovy is an obvious choice for language, but ruby seems well-
regarded for constructing simple DSLs.

Probably too time-consuming ever to be implemented, but nice to have
on the wishlist. (Actually, would be easy to do as Groovy hooks 
straight into the Puffin's guts; the hard bit would be designing
a DSL simple enough for people to use without intimate knowledge of
PP's internals.)
