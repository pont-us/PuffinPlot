title: Configurable axis scaling
desc: |-
  Not entirely sure what this one alluded to (I'm transcribing it from the
  old tdl bug-list) but I'm pretty sure it means "allow scaling of Z-plot
  for whole suite rather than single sample". This allows for easier
  side-by-side comparison of samples. Actually what's needed is scaling
  according to a selected bunch of samples within a suite: you wouldn't be
  publishing the graphs of the whole suite anyway, so you'd want to scale
  according to exactly those samples you were publishing.
