title: Standardize units for internal representation
desc: |-
  The units for PuffinPlot's internal data representation are at present
  implicitly defined as `whatever comes out of the 2G software'. They
  should be well-defined as the appropriate SI units, and converted on
  loading from whichever file format is being imported.
  (Original description was:
  These need to be explicitly represented at some point, to allow for
  cgs/si conversions in PuffinPlot, loading from datafiles with different
  conventions, etc.)

    Actually explicit representation would be overkill; Puffin's internal
    representation just needs to be well-defined. In a sense it is already
    well-defined as "whatever comes out of the 2G software" but it would
    be neater to convert these to standard SI units upon loading. As soon
    as Puffin grows the ability to import other data formats, using the
    fairly arbitrary 2G units (CGS, implicit orders of magnitude, etc.)
    for internal representation becomes a little ridiculous.

    Changed title and description to reflect a rethink on how to deal
    with this.

    Most internal representations now converted to SI;
    appropriate conversions implemented for 2G and old Puffin file
    loading. Leaving open until I've checked the mag. sus. units.
