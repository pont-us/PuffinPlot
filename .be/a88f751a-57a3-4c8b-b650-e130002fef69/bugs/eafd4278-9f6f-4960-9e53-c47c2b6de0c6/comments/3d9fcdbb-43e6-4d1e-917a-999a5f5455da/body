Although PuffinPlot has a scripting mode, it's not really coupled 
to interactive operation: it would be useful to produce a script from
an interactive session which would replay all that session's operations
to recreate the same result. This would be an excellent way to ensure
that results were reproducible, and to make PuffinPlot processing
workflows inspectable. It could probably be done using some form of
the GoF Command Pattern. Python seems like the most sensible choice
for the scripts, since PuffinPlot already bundles the Jython 
interpreter. This would also lay a foundation for undo/redo in 
PuffinPlot, although this would additionally require coding an inverse
operation for each PuffinPlot command -- perhaps not worthwhile until
some demand for undo/redo has been demonstrated.
