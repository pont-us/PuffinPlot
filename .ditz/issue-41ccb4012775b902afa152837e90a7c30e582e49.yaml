title: PuffinPlot crashes if AMS plot is visible
desc: |-
  See email from Claudio, 2011-12-11. Cause appears to be passing 
  a null value to Collections.unmodifiableCollection in 
  Suite.getAmsBootstrapParams.

    Fixed: list is now made unmodifiable by KentParams on creation,
    so don't need to rewrap it in Suite. Also opened a bug (#194)
    to refactor KentParams so as to make it less prone to this kind
    of problem.
