title: Revise discussion of PCA in manual
desc: "Gary Acton writes:\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98I noticed in the PuffinPlot manual that\n\
  the authors suggest anchored PCA is the primary PCA to use. I don't actually\n\
  agree with that as many data fail to decay precisely to the origin of a\n\
  Zijderveld plot and thus the unanchored version will be needed.\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  Revise the appropriate section of the manual."
