At the moment we have SVG export via Batik, and PDF export via
printing if the OS has a PDF printer driver. It would be good to
have built-in PDF export (so e.g. Windows users don't have to 
install a PDF printer driver, and so we get consistent output
across platforms). The two main options for PDF seem to be iText
and FreeHEP. FreeHEP also includes SVG (and several other) export
formats, so if it works well, it could potentially also replace
Batik.
