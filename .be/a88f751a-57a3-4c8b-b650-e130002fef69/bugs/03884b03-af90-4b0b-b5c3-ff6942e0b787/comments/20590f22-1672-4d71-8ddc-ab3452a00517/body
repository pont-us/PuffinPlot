Long cores really need to be on a par with discrete suites in terms
of multiple sample selection. Unfortunately a standard JSlider can't
do this; there are third-party range sliders available but
implementing my own is probably the easiest, since I don't actually
need much functionality. Most intuitive way would probably two
adjacent vertical strips, one showing the `pointer' (current sample),
the other the range (if any).
