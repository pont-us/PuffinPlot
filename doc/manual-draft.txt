Selecting points
----------------

You can select a point, or deselect a selected point, by clicking on it 
with the left mouse button.

Holding down shift activates "sloppy selection mode": if you left-click
while holding shift, all points within a small radius of the pointer will 
be selected. If you right-click while holding shift, all points within
a small radius of the pointer will be deselected.


Corrections for sample and formation orientation and magnetic deviation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PuffinPlot will make use of the sample and formation corrections 
specified in its input file, but these values can be changed by selecting
one or more samples and choosing "Corrections..." from the Edit menu.
Select the corrections you'd like to change and enter the new values.

This window also allows you to apply a correction for magnetic deviation
to one or more samples.
