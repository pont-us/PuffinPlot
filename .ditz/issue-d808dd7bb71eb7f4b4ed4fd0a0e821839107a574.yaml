    Done, with some refactoring: PlotPoint has changed from a private
    inner class to an interface, implemented by SquarePoint (containing
    the guts of the former PlotPoint) and the new TextLinePoint, which
    draws a line of the table as a data point, making it susceptible to
    selection.
