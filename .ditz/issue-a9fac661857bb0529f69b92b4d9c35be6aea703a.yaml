title: "MS integration: shift from Sample to Suite"
desc: |-
  MS data is transferred to the corresponding demag Datum in
  Sample.addDatum. This would be more appropriately done in Suite, since
  it is more obvious there that the lines are immediately adjacent,
  which is the only clue in a 2G file that they are related.

    Fixed yet more sensibly: the integration has been moved to the recently
    devolved TwoGeeLoader class, so PuffinPlot's data model never has to be
    aware of the `moment and susceptibility in separate lines' phenomenon.
