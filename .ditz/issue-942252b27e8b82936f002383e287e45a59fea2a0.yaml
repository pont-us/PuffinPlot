title: Copy/set selection by demag. range
desc: |-
  A problem that Christian described a while ago: if your
  demagnetization steps aren't uniform across the suite, copying
  point selections is a problem since the same sequential set
  of steps won't correspond to the same actual range of treatment
  intensities. So we need an interface for (1) selecting a user-
  specified treatment intensity range or (2) copying the intensity
  range from the current sample and applying it to the selection
  or (3) both.
