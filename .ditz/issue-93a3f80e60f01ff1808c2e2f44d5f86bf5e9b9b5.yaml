title: Cache (some) lines on equal-area plots
desc: |-
  The inefficient method of drawing the lines on the equal-area plots
  is producing quite noticeable lag. For every refresh, every line
  segment is recalculated from scratch. So, for example, for an A95
  confidence interval this means calculating a small circle of Vec3s,
  segmenting it in case it crosses the equator, then projecting the
  parts onto the plot area. All these operations are computationally
  expensive. Projected lines on equal-area plots need to be cached
  and only updated at need -- possibly not all of them, but profiling
  can identify the worst culprits.
