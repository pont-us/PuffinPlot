title: Add capability to lock axis scale across samples
desc: |-
  When publishing several z-plots from a suite, it's common practice
  to use the same scale for them all. Currently PuffinPlot scales
  purely according to the current sample. There should be a capability to
  scale to a selection, or to the whole suite.
