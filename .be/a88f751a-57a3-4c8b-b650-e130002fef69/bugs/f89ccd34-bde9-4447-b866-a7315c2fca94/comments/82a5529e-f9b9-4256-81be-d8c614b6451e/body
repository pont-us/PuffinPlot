Gary Acton reports:
‘Neither the menu selection nor the Ctrl-R or Apple-R
allowed me to use the unanchored PCA.’
A little baffling, since it works for everyone else.
My best guess is that he doesn't realize that ‘Anchor PCA’
is a toggle item which he must disable to get an unanchored PCA,
rather assuming that ‘PCA’ and ‘Anchor PCA’ immediately
calculate anchored and unanchored PCAs respectively.
In this case, it's a problem of poor GUI design and/or poor 
documentation. Probably the easiest fix would be to improve the
documentation, tool tips, and menu item wording.
