    I think I've just accidentally reproduced this, or something like
    it. Create a site direction with an a95 region that crosses the 
    equator -- it just gets cut off straight rather than having the
    "other" part correctly projected! "Straight" here meaning a 
    straight line on-screen rather than on the sphere.

    Despite my earlier comment, I can't reproduce this now. I'm 
    beginning to suspect that it's actually an artefact of the way 
    equator-crossing small circles project on an EA plot: if (say)
    the centre of the circle is a little below the equator, the 
    upper half will plot as a relatively straight line, which looks
    odd but does actually conform to the projection. Next steps on
    this one: contact JMG for an example file. If he supplied one,
    check PuffinPlot's plot vs. any other implementations I can
    find of EA plots -- PmagPy might be a good start.
