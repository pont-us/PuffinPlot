title: Replace JavaApplicationStub with a symlink
desc: |-
  Wouldn't save much space (it's only 6.3K gzipped) but would assauge
  any worries about redistributing Apple code.

    http://www.snailshell.de/blog/archives/2006/01/entry_37.html reports
    that "...this approach does not work as expected - you cannot use
    more than one Java application that uses the linked stub at the same
    time... So it seems we'll have to wait for Apple to provide a reliable
    solution". Ho ho ho. That's a shame, but any actual problems with
    incompatibility of JavaAPplicationStub versions (which is the most
    serious problem addressed by this technique) can be remdied on an
    as-needed basis.
