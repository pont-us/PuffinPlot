title: Drop JAMA for PCA calculation
desc: |-
  IIRC I'm only using JAMA to calculate eigenvectors for PCA
  analysis. If so it might be worth coding the calculation in
  PuffinPlot itself and dropping JAMA, which accounts for almost 10%
  of PuffinPlot's source code (although of course in the binary it's
  dwarfed by Batik and FreeHEP). Note that the calculation should
  be simplified by the fact that we know the matrix to be symmetric.
  DAIE does it in an Excel spreadsheet which (with all due respect
  to Leo's ingenuity) implies it's not *too* hairy.
