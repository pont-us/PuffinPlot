At present ‘Fisher by site’ and ‘Great circles’ open up 
new windows containing a single large equal-area plot.
These are at least partially redundant now that there are 
site and suite equal area plots in the main window. Easiest
would probably be to retain them, but rename them (to ‘site’
and ‘suite’ something), and don't open them automatically.
Add the site (great-circle) plot to the Windows menu to
let it be opened automatically. They're still handy for
a quick close-up without having to edit the main plot layout.
