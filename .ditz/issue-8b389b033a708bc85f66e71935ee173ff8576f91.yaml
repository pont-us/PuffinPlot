title: Allow import of sample-level data
desc: |-
  So far two users (Christian and Bruce McFadden) have expressed a
  need to use PuffinPlot for simple directional data (presumably 
  sample directions obtained from a different program). PuffinPlot 
  doesn't currently allow this: even the custom import dialog will
  read every line of the file as a demagnetization point. I can 
  envisage a somewhat unpleasant hack involving flipping directions,
  anchored PCA to "promote" step directions to sample directions, etc.
  but it's probably better to do it properly. Shouldn't be too hard
  but there are probably a few places in the code where I assume that
  there will be at least one demagnetization step associated with a
  sample.
