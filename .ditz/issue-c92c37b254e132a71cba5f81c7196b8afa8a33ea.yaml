title: Sensible units for intensity values
desc: |-
  Any way to change the way intensity values are displayed. I have
  corrected intensity values in my composite dotDAT file to S.I.
  thus my mag intensity is now displayed as 3540000. Is it possible
  to have a flexible abbreviation rather than being stuck with
  x10-7. It will make life a bit more manageable when trying to
  think ones way through magnetic intensity. Or maybe we could have
  a self correcting feature? i.e. change a drop down box from emu
  to Am. WOW... [from Christian]

    I'm assuming that this relates to the values displayed on the 
    on-graph data table, since the values on graph axes are automatically
    scaled.

    Looks as though this was fixed some time ago -- values are now displayed
    inscientific notation and no overall OOM scaling is applied. Unsure
    how to interpret C's last sentence there, but it seems to be a vague
    notion rather than a definite feature request, so I'm closing this now
    on the assumption that if he really wants a "self correcting feature"
    he'll ask for it again, at which point I can ask him what he means.
    (Asking him now, over email to the JOIDES Resolution, what he meant
    5+ months ago would probably not be worthwhile.)
