Looks as though this was already fixed some time ago -- there is
definitely an explicit clip being applied in ZPlot.drawLine, and it 
seems to be fine in PDF and SVG exports as tested by both me and 
Faye. The only niggle is that the PCA line can sometimes overwrite
the window scroll bars, but this is relatively minor. I'll open a 
new bug for it.
