title: Set a custom application icon
desc: |-
  It should be possible to use the Puffin (rather than default Java)
  icon even for the non-Mac versions. See
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209812 .

    Note that this will require Java 6 (see 
    http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Window.html#setIconImage%28java.awt.Image%29 ).
    Shouldn't be a problem -- the only people who can't get Java 6 are on
    PPC or 32-bit Intel Macs, and most of those machines are probably dead
    by now.

    Now using Window.setIconImages. Seems fine on Windows. A bit 
    ropey on Ubuntu but I don't think the problem there is at my end.
    (Works fine from command line, default icon when run from file
    manager. Very odd.) Suspect there's nothing I can do about it,
    so I'm closing this bug and hoping that a future Ubuntu release will
    fix the problem.
