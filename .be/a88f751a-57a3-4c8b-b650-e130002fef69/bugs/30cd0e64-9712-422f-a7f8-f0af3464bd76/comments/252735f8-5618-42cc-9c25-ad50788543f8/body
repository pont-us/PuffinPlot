I've compared the counterintuitively strange-looking projection with
PmagPy's equarea_ell.py and with Stereonet v9. equarea_ell is a bit
buggy and actually plots two (very similar) projected lines; PuffinPlot
matches one of them exactly. PuffinPlot also matches Stereonet's
projection. Absent a test case from JMG, I'm closing this as can't
reproduce.
