If an imported file doesn't contain enough data to construct a
vector for each demagnetization step, PuffinPlot will just quietly
work with what it has, even if it's all defaulting to zero. It should
warn the user that the imported data is incomplete, in case they 
have made a mistake in specifying the import fields.
