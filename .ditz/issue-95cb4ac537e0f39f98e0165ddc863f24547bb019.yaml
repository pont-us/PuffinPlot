title: Implement saving
desc: |-
  User needs to be able to save the whole current state -- loaded files,
  selections, calculations, etc. Obviously some careful thought needed
  about how to do this sensibly; it will probably involve packing up
  all the loaded files into a zip, with another file of metadata.
