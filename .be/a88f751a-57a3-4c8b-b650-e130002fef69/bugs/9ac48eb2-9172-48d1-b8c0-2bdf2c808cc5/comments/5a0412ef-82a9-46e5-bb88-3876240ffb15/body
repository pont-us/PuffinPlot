Lots of imported files are under-specified, and PuffinPlot has
to guess or use default values for things like sample volume and
treatment type. The user should be allowed to configure defaults
for such values. Implementation shouldn't be too hard using
DatumField and Sample.setValue -- cf. EditSampleParametersWindow.
