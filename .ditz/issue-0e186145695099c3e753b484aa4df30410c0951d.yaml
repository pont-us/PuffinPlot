title: Better feedback to user on importing malformed files
desc: |-
  If an imported file doesn't contain enough data to construct a
  vector for each demagnetization step, PuffinPlot will just quietly
  work with what it has, even if it's all defaulting to zero. It should
  warn the user that the imported data is incomplete, in case they 
  have made a mistake in specifying the import fields.
