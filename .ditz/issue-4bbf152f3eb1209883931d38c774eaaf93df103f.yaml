    The Apple equivalent of a * in the title bar seems to be the the
    Window.documentModified client property, documented at
    http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2007/tn2196.html#WINDOW_DOCUMENTMODIFIED .
    On Macs, the menu title should also flash briefly when a hotkey is
    pressed, which would also give useful visual feedback that saving is
    taking place. But this isn't implemented in Apple Java and I can't think
    of any way to work around it.
    http://lists.apple.com/archives/Java-dev/2008/Nov/msg00239.html seems
    to confirm this.
