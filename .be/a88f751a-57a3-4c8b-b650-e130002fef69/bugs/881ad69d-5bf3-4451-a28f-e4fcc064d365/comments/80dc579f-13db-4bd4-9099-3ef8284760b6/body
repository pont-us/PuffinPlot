This would avoid the need to pass around the "use empty correction"
flag for all operations needing the magnetization vector. The value
would be stored per-Datum as with current sample properties, to 
preserve the flat file format. This would also allow different samples
to have different settings -- e.g. if there are two empty slots in
a run (though that might involve complicating the interface confusingly
for little practical benefit).
