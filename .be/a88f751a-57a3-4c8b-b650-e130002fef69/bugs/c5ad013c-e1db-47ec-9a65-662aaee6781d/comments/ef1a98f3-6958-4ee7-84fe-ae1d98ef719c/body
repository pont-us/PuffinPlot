Any way to change the way intensity values are displayed. I have
corrected intensity values in my composite dotDAT file to S.I.
thus my mag intensity is now displayed as 3540000. Is it possible
to have a flexible abbreviation rather than being stuck with
x10-7. It will make life a bit more manageable when trying to
think ones way through magnetic intensity. Or maybe we could have
a self correcting feature? i.e. change a drop down box from emu
to Am. WOW... [from Christian]
