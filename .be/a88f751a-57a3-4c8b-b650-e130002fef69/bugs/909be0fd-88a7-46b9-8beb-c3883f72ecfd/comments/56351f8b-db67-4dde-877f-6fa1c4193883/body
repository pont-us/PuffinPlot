Datum is now pretty unambiguous: it provides (get|set)(DiscreteId|Depth)
and getIdOrDepth which switches on measurement type. `Sample ID' perhaps
not such a good `ambiguous' designator, since it's used exclusively
for discrete ID in the 2G file format. But nevertheless Suite is now
using `samplesById' internally which is probably a good balance of
conciseness and clarity.
