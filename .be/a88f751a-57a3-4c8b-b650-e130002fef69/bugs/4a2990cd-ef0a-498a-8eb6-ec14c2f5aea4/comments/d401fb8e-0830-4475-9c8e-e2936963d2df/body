JavaHelp appears to be dead -- last release in 2007, last commit in
2011, mailing lists dead for years. The possible replacement, Oracle
Help, has rather murky licensing terms which seem unlikely to be GPL
compatible. In any case, with an extensive HTML and PDF manual now
provided both for download and online reading, adding an extra built-in
manual seems like a poor use of time. I'm closing this as "fixed" on
the basis of the existing manuals and in-application tooltips.
