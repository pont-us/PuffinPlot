  abstract ={The tensors considered in this paper are the linear
    relationships between certain pairs of physical vector quantities which
    may be described by 3 Ã— 3 symmetric matrices. Such a linear relationship
    may well vary from point to point in a non-homogeneous medium. From
    measurements at a given point in the medium, the least squares estimates
    of the components of the tensor at that point are obtained; from these
    the tensor's principal axes may be estimated. On the assumption that the
    errors of measurement are small and normally distributed, confidence
    intervals for the lengths of the principal axes are derived, together
    with confidence regions on the unit sphere for the directions of these
    axes.Tests for equality of pairs of principal axes, for isotropy, and for
    comparing the tensors at two or more points are given.In certain common
    experimental situations, a design for this work may be represented by a
    set of points on the unit sphere. If such a design is rotatable (Box &
    Hunter, 1957), the estimates have optimum properties, and the confidence
    intervals and regions take on particularly simple forms. Seven rotatable
    designs are given, which should cover most practical requirements.These
    results are illustrated with a numerical example and diagram, taken from
    recent work on rock magnetism. Finally, all the results are extended to
    more general symmetric matrices, and some further rotatable designs are
    given.},

  abstract = {The common ferromagnetic minerals have distinctive,
    characteristic coercivities and thermomagnetic properties. The analysis of
    the acquisition curve of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) is a
    useful but often ambiguous diagnostic technique. For a more conclusive
    interpretation, IRM acquisition must be combined with subsequent thermal
    demagnetization of the IRM. A modification of this method is proposed as a
    more powerful analytical technique. Different coercivity fractions of IRM
    are remagnetized in successively smaller fields along three orthogonal
    directions. The thermal demagnetization of each orthogonal component of
    the composite IRM is then plotted separately. This method often gives a
    clearer interpretation of the ferromagnetic mineral content of a
    rock. Examples are described for limestone and sandstone samples.},
