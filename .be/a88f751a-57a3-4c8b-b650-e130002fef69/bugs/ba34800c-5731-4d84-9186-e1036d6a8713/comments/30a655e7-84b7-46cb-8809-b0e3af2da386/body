To reproduce: select TRAY_NORMAL_YFLIP for 2G protocol in
Preferences. Open a 2G file measured using a single-measurement
protocol. Expected: PuffinPlot reports an error on reading the
file and suggests than it might be caused by an incorrect protocol
selection. Actual: Puffin crashes due to a "null line in readDatum"
at TwoGeeLoader.java:269.
