Have discussed with Christian. We thrashed out the notion of a
preview window for tabulated data of unknown format, which would allow
the user to specify which columns meant what. This is technically
straightforward, but will require some careful UI decisions.
Christian has put the word out for examples of other data formats,
so I should have something to work with soon.
