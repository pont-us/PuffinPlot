title: More comprehensible site and suite calculations
desc: "This one might require a little thought. Anonymous \n\
  reviewer writes:\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98The major flaw that was found is in the process of defining the set of\n\
  samples in each site, making sure the PCA analyses ended up in that site,\n\
  and then figuring out a simple way to view and analyze the site mean\n\
  results. This part of the analysis process is very cryptic, and not easy\n\
  to examine or modify. It would be a significant improvement if a data\n\
  table with sample name, PCA results, and the Fisher mean and stats were\n\
  also included in a window- preferable an interactive window (so data can\n\
  be coded, deleted, etc) along with the Site Equal Area plot. Although the\n\
  process would become more familiar with practice, I was never very\n\
  confident that the right results of the PCA analyses were being used for\n\
  the site mean (it took a bit of very close examination to determine this\n\
  was in fact working). The great-circle analysis was very good at the\n\
  individual sample level, but was also a bit cryptic when examining the\n\
  site-level or suite-level results.\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  Since this is described as \xE2\x80\x98the major flaw\xE2\x80\x99 I should be thorough\n\
  in addressing it."

    I have now added a table which shows sample directions within the
    current site. It is slightly interactive, in that clicking on a line
    will jump to the appropriate sample.

    I have added a site parameter table to complement the sample
    parameter table. Like its predecessor, it can change the current 
    sample when the user clicks on it. I think that this should be
    enough to address the concerns of the reviewer.
