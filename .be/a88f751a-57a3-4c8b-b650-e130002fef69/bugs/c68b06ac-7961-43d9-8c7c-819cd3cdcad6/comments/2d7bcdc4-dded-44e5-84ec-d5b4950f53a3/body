The new data append feature doesn't do much sanity checking and
it would probably be possible to force a crash or some very odd
behaviour by trying to combine incompatible files -- e.g. appending
a discrete file to a continuous suite. Subject it to some unpleasant
tests and make sure that it declines gracefully in such cases.
