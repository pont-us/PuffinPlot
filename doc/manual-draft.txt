Selecting points
----------------

You can select a point, or deselect a selected point, by clicking on it 
with the left mouse button.

Holding down shift activates "sloppy selection mode": if you left-click
while holding shift, all points within a small radius of the pointer will 
be selected. If you right-click while holding shift, all points within
a small radius of the pointer will be deselected.
