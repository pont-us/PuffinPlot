title: Tidy up print and vector export code
desc: |-
  The code for printing, PDF export, and SVG export has grown in
  a somewhat ad-hoc fashion and probably needs a little tidying up
  and refactoring. Among other things, it's not clear that double
  buffering is disabled in all the vector export routines. So far I've
  never come across any evidence of accidental double-buffering (e.g.
  a huge bitmapped PDF export) but it's probably worth doing the due
  diligence.
