title: Clip PCA lines so they don't overwrite scroll bars
desc: |-
  If the Zplot is at the bottom or right edge of the main window, and 
  the scroll bar is shown, the PCA lines (if shown) overwrite the scroll
  bar. At present, the PCA lines are explicitly clipped to the ZPlot's
  area. They also need to be clipped to the window's drawing area
  (excluding the scroll bars) in order to avoid messing up the window
  furniture.
