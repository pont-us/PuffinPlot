Added some new suite-level data fields: datestamps for creation
and last modification; identifying strings for the program that
originally created the file and the program that last saved it;
and the original filetype from which the PuffinPlot file was
created. User name omitted for privacy reasons -- very unlikely
to have any practical repercussions but it doesn't seem right
to include by default (and not worth adding a configuration 
option). Might consider adding some system information (OS,
locale, etc.) but this is mainly useful for debugging and in
that case it should all be in the PUFFIN-ERROR file anyway.
