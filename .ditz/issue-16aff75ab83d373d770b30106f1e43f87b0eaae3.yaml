title: Embeddable viewer applet
desc: |-
  Maybe a bit ambitious, but I just noticed that Gary Acton thinks
  it's handy to have an animated GIF of demag data (each frame being
  the plots for one depth). What about bundling up data & some code
  for a minimal viewer applet -- essentially just the main window
  and slider of PuffinPlot? Would be a nice way to share data.
  Probably fairly niche use though, low priority.
