Now fixed as specified; while evaluating the fix, the bug reporter
found that AMS orientations were incorrect for another ASC file
of his. I discovered that this was because the file didn't use the
same orientation conventions as PuffinPlot. PuffinPlot now reads
the orientation parameters from the ASC file and automatically
converts the tensor and sample and formation corrections into its
own system. Tested successfully with the offending file, and I've
added a truncated version of it to the test suite. Waiting for
confirmation from the bug reporter before closing the ticket.
