title: Crash on saving recent file list
desc: "PuffinPlot can crash while shutting down if a it tries to save\n\
  a large number of files to the \xE2\x80\x98recent files\xE2\x80\x99 list: the length of\n\
  the string exceeds the maximum allowed by AbstractPreferences.put.\n\
  Solution should be simple: currently the full path of each file is\n\
  written separately; this could be shortened hugely by writing it\n\
  as parent directory followed by leafnames. For even better compression,\n\
  we could extract the longest common prefix and suffix, but it's\n\
  unlikely to be necessary."
