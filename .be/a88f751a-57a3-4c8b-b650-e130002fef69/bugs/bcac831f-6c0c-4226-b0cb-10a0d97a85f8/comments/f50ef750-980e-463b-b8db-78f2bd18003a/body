Maybe obvious in retrospect, but RenderingHints objects are not
immutable, and FreeHEP has a bug which wipes the entire RenderingHints
object passed to it. Since GraphDisplay caches a single instance
of PuffinRenderingHints (on the reasonable assumption that nobody is
going to change it), this same empty RenderingHints object is retained
and passed to the usual draw-to-screen Graphics2D once the SVG export
is complete.

Fixed by adding a dirty bit to PuffinRenderingHints so getInstance()
can instantiate a new, pristine object when necessary, and by 
getting rid of the RenderingHints cache in GraphDisplay.
