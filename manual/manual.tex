\section{Introduction}

This manual gives a practical guide to the usage of the PuffinPlot
palaeomagnetic data analysis program. Note that it does \emph{not} elucidate
the principles of the analysis techniques themselves, and a working knowledge
of palaeomagnetic procedures is assumed. For excellent introductions to
palaeomagnetic analysis, see \cite{tauxe2010paleomagnetism} or
\cite{butler1992paleomagnetism}.

\section{Installation}

This section describes the hardware and software requirements for
running PuffinPlot, and gives instructions for installing and running
it.

\subsection{Requirements}

PuffinPlot runs on the Java platform (version 5 or later), which is
preinstalled or freely available for a variety of operating systems,
including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Instructions for installing Java
are beyond the scope of this manual; please consult the documentation
for your operating system or visit \url{http://www.java.com/} for
details.

\subsection{Obtaining and installing PuffinPlot}

PuffinPlot is distributed in two variants. The first is suitable for all
operating systems. The second has identical functionality, but is
tailored for easier installation and use on Mac OS X. Mac users are
advised to use the second variant, although the first will also work for
them.

\subsubsection{All operating systems}

The latest `universal' version of PuffinPlot may be downloaded as a file
named \textsf{PuffinPlot.jar} from
\url{http://talvi.net/PuffinPlot.jar}. This file is recommended for
Linux, Windows, and other non-Mac operating systems.

The details of starting PuffinPlot vary between operating systems, but
double-clicking on the file \textsf{PuffinPlot.jar} is the most common
method. In some cases it may be necessary to right-click on the file and
select \emph{Open with Java runtime} or some similar text from a menu.
PuffinPlot can also be started from a terminal prompt by setting the
current folder to the one containing PuffinPlot, and typing
\textsf{java -jar PuffinPlot.jar}.

\subsubsection{Mac OS X}

The latest Mac OS X version of PuffinPlot may be downloaded as a file
named \textsf{PuffinPlot.zip} from
\url{http://talvi.net/PuffinPlot.zip}. This file is packaged as a
standard OS X application and conforms more nearly to OS X user
interface standards than the `universal' version described in the
previous section.

After downloading \textsf{PuffinPlot.zip}, double-click on it to
automatically extract the PuffinPlot application, denoted by an icon
representing a puffin (specifically, the Atlantic Puffin
\emph{Fratercula arctica}). The application may then be dragged into the
Applications folder, or any other convenient place.

PuffinPlot is started by double-clicking on its application icon.

\section{Basic usage}

This section gives a brief introduction to the PuffinPlot data model and
to the features of its main window.

\subsection{A note on keyboard shortcuts}

PuffinPlot provides a large number of keyboard shortcuts for its various
capabilities; most of them involve holding down the Ctrl key while
pressing another key. On Mac OS X, these shortcuts use the command key
rather than the Ctrl key, in accordance with Apple user interface
guidelines. Throughout this manual, keyboard shortcuts will be given as
(for example) Ctrl-A. Users of Mac OS X should read these shortcuts as
command-A, etc.

\subsection{Opening a file}

To open a file, select \textsf{Open\ldots} from the \textsf{File} menu. This
will allow you to choose one or more files to open from a standard file
selection window. You may also select an entire folder; in this case
every file within the folder will be opened.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\ifpdf\includegraphics{figures/annot-scrnshot.pdf}
\else\includegraphics{figures/annot-scrnshot.png}
\fi
\caption{The main window of PuffinPlot with a discrete file loaded,
showing the default data plot layout. Data plots, information displays,
and controls are annotated. Note that several other data plots are
available, but are not shown by default, and that the layout may be
freely rearranged by the user. Data points above the 275\textdegree C
demagnetization step have been hidden.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{A tour of the main window}

Figure 1 shows an annotated screenshot of PuffinPlot's main window with
a discrete sample data file open. The bulk of the window is devoted to
the data display itself, and shows the four most popular data display
methods for palaeomagnetic data: a table, a Zijderveld plot, an
equal-area projection, and a demagnetization-intensity biplot (which
also shows an overlaid magnetic susceptibility plot). The plots are
interactive, in that individual data points may be selected by clicking
or by dragging a rectangle with the mouse.

To the left of the main plot display area is the sample chooser, which shows
a complete list of the samples within the suite, with the currently selected
sample highlighted. Multiple samples may be selected at once allowing
functions such as \caps{pca} calculation to be performed \emph{en masse}. If
a long core data file is loaded, the sample chooser is shown as a vertical
slider indicating depth rather than a list of sample names.

Above the main plot area is the toolbar, which gives convenient access
to some of the most frequently used facilities of the program. From left
to right, these are: choosers for the currently displayed data suite,
the orientation correction, and the Zijderveld projection type; displays
of the sample and formation orientations and magnetic declination; and
buttons for three of the most commonly performed actions.

At the top of the window is the menu bar, providing access to all the
program's functions in a hierarchical manner. On Mac OS, the menu bar is
at the top of the screen rather than the top of the window, and includes
an extra menu at the left, entitled \textsf{PuffinPlot}.

\subsection{Data model}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\ifpdf\includegraphics{figures/data-model.pdf}
\else\includegraphics{figures/data-model.png}
\fi
\caption{PuffinPlot's hierarchical data model. Each layer (except the
lowest) contains multiple instances of the following layer.}
\end{figure}

PuffinPlot uses a hierarchical data structure, with higher levels
containing multiple instances of each lower level. The structure is
summarized in Figure 2. At the top is the \emph{suite}, which contains
all the data to be analysed as part of a particular study. For a
discrete specimen study, this will typically correspond to a section in
the field; for a long core study, it will correspond to a core. A suite
is initially created by opening one or more data files from a
magnetometer; it is saved as a file in PuffinPlot's own format. In a
discrete study, a suite contains multiple \emph{sites}. A site
corresponds to a set of samples taken from one spot in a section. A
site's associated data can include such things as bedding attitude and
stratigraphic height, as well as calculated parameters such as the mean
palaeomagnetic direction for all the samples at the site. For a long
core study, sites are not defined: samples are contained directly within
the suite.

Each site (or, for long core data, the suite) contains multiple
\emph{samples}. A sample corresponds to a small physical volume of rock.
For a discrete study, this will usually be a typical palaeomagnetic 25mm
cylinder or IODP cube sample. For long cores, it is the portion of the
core at a particular depth. The data associated with a sample consists
of information specific to this physical unit which does not change with
the application of demagnetization techniques --- for example, a sample
code or name (or, for long cores, a depth), the field orientation of the
sample, and its volume. For discrete samples this data can also include
a tensor representing anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, which is
imported separately from an Agico kappabridge datafile and collated with
the magnetization data by matching the sample names. The sample can also
contain calculated parameters, such as a direction fitted by principal
component analysis, or a best-fitting great circle.

Each sample contains multiple \emph{demagnetization steps}. A
\emph{step} represents a sample at a particular point during the
treatment protocol. Its associated data thus includes details of the
treatment: the type (thermal, AF, IRM, etc.) and parameters
(temperature, field strength, etc.). The data also includes the state of
the sample itself --- most importantly, the measured magnetization
vector. For thermal studies, the magnetic susceptibility is usually also
recorded after every heating cycle, and is also stored as part of the
step.

\subsection{Main window features}

This section describes the parts and functions of the main PuffinPlot
window, as shown in Figure 1.

\subsubsection{Plot area}

The plot area is the largest part of the window, and plots the data for
the current sample using various plots. By default, four plots are
shown: a demagnetization-intensity biplot, a Zijderveld plot, an
equal-area projection, and a table of demagnetization steps. The plots
can be moved and resized (see
in\{section\}{[}sec:manual-change-layout{]}). Other plots are also
available, and the preferences window can be used to control which plots
are displayed (see in\{section\}{[}sec:manual-preferences{]}).

\subsubsection{Sample chooser}

The sample chooser sits at the leftmost edge of the main window, and
allows you to change the current sample (the one for which data is
plotted) and the set of selected samples (most of PuffinPlot's functions
operate on the currently selected samples). Often, the set of selected
samples will consist only of the current sample.

The sample chooser takes two forms, depending on whether the current
suite of data is for discrete samples or for a continuous long core
measurement.

\paragraph{Using the discrete sample chooser}

The discrete sample chooser shows the names of the samples in the current
suite. The selected sample or samples are highlighted in a different colour.
If more than one sample is selected, the first of them is displayed in the
main plot area.

To select a single sample, click on its name. To select a contiguous range of
samples, click at one end of the range, then hold down \ppcmd{Shift} while
clicking at the other end of the range. To select multiple, non-contiguous
samples, hold down \ppcmd{Ctrl} while clicking. To select all samples, press
\ppcmd{Ctrl-A}.

\paragraph{Using the continuous sample chooser}

The continuous sample chooser is a vertical grey bar representing the total
length of the measured core, striped with horizontal white lines representing
the individual measurements at each depth. (If there are too many
measurements for all the requisite white lines to be displayed, they are
omitted.) A black triangle and line show the current depth. The selected
samples are denoted with orange highlighting.

To select a single depth, click on the appropriate part of the sample
chooser. To scroll rapidly through a range of samples, click and drag the
mouse along the sample chooser. To select a range of samples, hold down
\ppcmd{Shift}, then click, drag, and release the mouse on the chooser.

\paragraph{Keyboard shortcuts for sample selection}

Use \ppcmd{Ctrl-B} and \ppcmd{Ctrl-N} to change the current sample. Use
\ppcmd{Ctrl-A} to select all the samples in the current suite. You can also
use the up and down arrow keys to change the sample.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:manual-toolbar}Toolbar}

The toolbar displays various data and provides several controls.
From left to right, these are:

\begin{description}

\item[Suite chooser.] This shows the name of the current suite of
data. If more than one suite of data has been opened, the suite chooser
allows you to switch between them.

\item[Orientation correction chooser.] This chooser allows you to
choose whether data is displayed in laboratory co-ordinates
(\ppcmd{uncorrected}), in field co-ordinates, corrected for sample orientation
(\ppcmd{samp. corr.}), or in tectonic co-ordinates, corrected for both
sample orientation and bedding orientation (\ppcmd{form. corr.}).

\item[Zijderveld projection type.] This chooser controls the vertical
projection used in the Zijderveld plot. The {\em y} axis always corresponds
to the vertical direction; the chooser controls the {\em x} axis, which may
correspond to North (\ppcmd{V vs. N}) or East (\ppcmd{V vs. E}). The third
option, \ppcmd{V vs. H}, projects each data point separately, in the plane
containing itself and the origin; this is sometimes referred to as a
`modified Zijderveld' plot.

\item[Sample orientation] (\ppcmd{Samp}). The first number is the
azimuth of the sample orientation; the second is its dip. For a long core,
all these values will usually be 0 and 90 respectively throughout the core.

\item[Formation orientation] (\ppcmd{Form}). The first number is the
dip direction of the bedding; the second in the dip magnitude.

\item[Magnetic declination] (\ppcmd{Dev}). This is the angle between
magnetic north and true north at the sampling site.

\item[Select all] selects all the points in the current sample.

\item[\caps{Pca}] performs principal component analysis for the
selected points of all the selected samples.

\item[Clear calculations] de-selects all the points in all the
selected samples, and clears the results of any calculations done on them,
such as \caps{pca} or great-circle analysis.

\end{description}

\section{Detailed usage}

This section gives a methodical account of PuffinPlot's features.

\subsection{Catalogue of functions}

This section lists all the items in PuffinPlot's menus, giving a brief
description of the functionality associated with each one.

\subsubsection{File menu}

This menu contains functions connected with opening, closing, and
saving files.

\begin{menuitemlist}

\item[File\submenu Open\ldots] loads one or more files of demagnetization
  data into PuffinPlot as a new suite. See
  section~\ref{sec:manual-file-types} for details of supported filetypes.

\item[File\submenu Open recent file] is a submenu which
contains the names of the last eight files which have been opened in
PuffinPlot, allowing them to be opened again with a single click.

\item[File\submenu Save] saves the current suite as a PuffinPlot file. If
the suite was opened from a PuffinPlot file or if it has been previously
saved as a PuffinPlot file, it will immediately be saved to that file. If no
PuffinPlot file is associated with this suite yet, a standard ‘save file’
dialog box will prompt you for a file name and location.

\item[File\submenu Save as\ldots] allows you to save the current suite to a
different filename or location.

\item[File\submenu Close] closes the current suite, removing it from
PuffinPlot's data display.

\item[File\submenu Export data] is a submenu allowing the export of
various kinds of data to \caps{csv} files.

\item[File\submenu Export data\submenu sample calculations\ldots] saves a file
containing all the data associated with individual samples.
Table~\ref{tbl:manual-export-sample} describes the fields which make
up the file.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\item[File\submenu Export data\submenu site calculations\ldots] saves a file
containing (for suites with discrete samples) all the data associated with
sites. Table~\ref{tbl:manual-export-site} describes the fields
which make up this file.

\begin{table}[p]

  \caption{\label{tbl:manual-export-site} List of fields in exported site data file}

    path for an individual sample, and \caps{t}2 the last (highest). \caps{t}1min
    is the minimum of the \caps{t}1 values across all the circles for the site,
    and \caps{t}2 the maximum. Similarly, \caps{t}2 is the last step used in a
    single circle, and \caps{t}2min--\caps{t}2max is the range of its values
    across all the samples at a site.} \\
  \caps{t}1max &   \\
  \caps{t}2min &   \\
  \caps{t}2max &   \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\item[File\submenu Export data\submenu suite calculations\ldots] saves a
  \caps{csv} file containing only one line of data, which gives the mean
  inclination, mean declination, \alnifi{}, and {\em k} for the Fisherian mean
  direction calculated for the entire suite.

\item[File\submenu Export data\submenu IRM data\ldots] saves files containing
\caps{irm} acquisition data. It produces a folder of files, one for each
sample in the suite. Each file is in tab-delimited text format, and each line
within the file contains the \caps{irm} field strength and the magnetization
intensity of the sample after application of that field.

\item[File\submenu Page Setup\ldots] opens a window allowing you
to change the paper size, orientation, and margins for printing.

\item[File\submenu Print\ldots] opens a window allowing you to print the
selected samples. Note that {\em only} the selected samples will be printed,
so if you wish to print the whole suite use \ppcmd{Edit\submenu Select all} first.
On most systems this will also allow you to print to a \caps{pdf} file;
Windows users may need to install a virtual \caps{pdf} printer, such as
Cute\caps{pdf} Writer or Bullzip \caps{pdf} Printer, in order to produce
\caps{pdf} files.

\item[File\submenu Print Fisher\ldots] prints the contents of the separate
window showing Fisher statistics of \caps{pca} directions through the suite;
see \ppcmd{Calculations\submenu Fisher on suite} in
section~\ref{sec:manual-functions-calcs} for more details.

\item[File\submenu Print Great Circles\ldots] prints the contents of the
  separate great-circle fit window; see \ppcmd{Calculations\submenu Great
    circles} in section~\ref{sec:manual-functions-calcs} for more details.

\item[File\submenu Import AMS] imports \caps{ams} data from a file. The
file must be in the \caps{.asc} format produced by the \ppcmd{Safyr} program
distributed with \caps{Agico} kappabridges. The \caps{ams} data is assigned
to the appropriate samples within the suite by matching the sample names
specified in the \caps{asc} file with the sample names for the
demagnetization data. If the \caps{ams} file contains data for samples not in
the suite, these samples will be created and added to the suite. \caps{Ams}
data is not displayed by default; the equal-area plot of \caps{ams} data can
be activated from the \ppcmd{Preferences} window.

\item[File\submenu Export SVG] saves the current contents of the main
data display as an \caps{svg} (Scalable Vector Graphics) file. As a vector
graphics format, \caps{svg} is allows for high-quality reproduction at any
size. It can also be easily edited and incorporated into other graphics using
vector graphics programs such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.

\item[File\submenu Export preferences\ldots] saves your current preferences to
a file. In conjunction with the \ppcmd{Import preferences} feature, this
allows you to transfer your preferences from one computer to another. It also
allows you to keep multiple sets of preferences and switch between them as
needed. Probably the most useful application is to save different plot
layouts for different sets of data.

\item[File\submenu Import preferences\ldots] sets your preferences from
a file saved using \ppcmd{Export preferences}. See the description of
\ppcmd{Export preferences} for details.

\item[File\submenu Preferences\ldots] opens the preferences window. See
section~\ref{sec:manual-preferences} for details. On Mac OS X, this item is
found on the \ppcmd{PuffinPlot} menu to the left of the \ppcmd{File} menu,
rather than on the \ppcmd{File} menu.

\item[File\submenu Quit] terminates PuffinPlot. On Mac OS X, this item is
found on the \ppcmd{PuffinPlot} menu to the left of the \ppcmd{File} menu,
rather than on the \ppcmd{File} menu.

\end{menuitemlist}

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Edit menu}

The \ppcmd{Edit} menu provides various basic functions mainly
to do with manipulation of data points.

\begin{menuitemlist}

\item[Edit\submenu Select all] selects all the points in all the selected
samples, excluding points which have been hidden (see \ppcmd{Hide points}
below).

\item[Edit\submenu Clear selection] de-selects all the points in all
the selected samples.

\item[Edit\submenu Move plots] allows you to reposition and resize the plots
  in the main display area. See section~\ref{sec:manual-move-plots} for
  details.

\item[Edit\submenu Reset layout] resets the sizes and positions of
all the plots to their default values.

\item[Edit\submenu Corrections\ldots] opens a window which allows you to
change the sample orientation, formation orientation, and local magnetic
declination for all the selected samples. Each correction type can be
individually changed without affecting the values of the others.

\item[Edit\submenu Copy point selection] takes the points which are
selected for the current sample, and selects the corresponding points
for all the selected samples. This is useful, for example, for hiding
the same points in a large number of samples without having to
manually select them for each sample.

%\item[Edit\submenu Flip sample(s)]

\item[Edit\submenu Hide points] hides all the selected points in all the
selected samples. This removes them from all the graphical plots (which will
be rescaled to avoid unnecessary blank space), but not from the data table in
the main plot window; on the data table, hidden data points are marked with a
dash symbol (--) to their left. Hidden points can be restored using the

\item[Edit\submenu Show all points] restores all hidden points in all
the selected samples.

%\item[Edit\submenu Use as empty slot]

%\item[Edit\submenu Unset empty slot]

%\item[Edit\submenu Apply empty correction]

\item[Edit\submenu Edit custom flags\ldots] allows you to add or remove
user-defined flags for the suite; see section~\ref{sec:manual-annotations}
for details.

\item[Edit\submenu Edit custom notes\ldots] allows you to add or remove
  user-defined note categories for the suite; see
  section~\ref{sec:manual-annotations} for details.

\item[Edit\submenu Rescale mag. sus.] scales all the magnetic
susceptibility values for the suite by a specified factor. This is
useful since magnetic susceptibility meters typically do not report
values in standard S.I. units. Note that, unlike many PuffinPlot operations,
the scaling is applied to the {\em entire suite}, not just the selected
samples.

\end{menuitemlist}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:manual-functions-calcs}Calculations menu}

The calculations menu provides facilities for calculating magnetic
parameters and directions. Note that most calculations operate on
all the selected samples, not just the current sample.

\begin{menuitemlist}

\item[Calculations\submenu PCA] calculates a best-fitting line to all the
selected points in all the selected samples, using principal component
analysis \citep[kirschvink1980least]. The \caps{pca} direction is projected
onto the Zijderveld plot.

\item[Calculations\submenu Anchor PCA] is a menu item which may be
toggled on or off. When it is on, \caps{pca} analyses are constrained to pass
through the origin. In general, the \caps{pca} should be anchored when the
analysed points are known to represent the final demagnetization component.
Leaving it unanchored allows analysis of secondary components, provided
that they are sufficiently well separated from other components.

\item[Calculations\submenu Fisher by sample] calculates, for each
selected sample, a Fisherian mean direction for all the selected points. This
can produce reasonable mean directions for origin-trending components, but
principal component analysis is usually preferable.

\item[Calculations\submenu Fisher by site] calculates a Fisherian
mean direction for the \caps{pca} directions at each site.

\item[Calculations\submenu Fisher on suite] calculates a Fisherian
mean of the \caps{pca} directions for all the selected samples, and
opens a new window showing an equal-area plot of the \caps{pca} directions,
the mean direction, and the 95\% confidence circle.

\item[Calculations\submenu MDF] calculates the Median Destructive Field
(or, for thermal demagnetization, the Median Destructive Temperature) of the
selected samples. This is the field (or temperature) at which the intensity
of the sample's remanence has been reduced to half of its initial value. Once
calculated, it is displayed on the demagnetization-intensity plot, and can be
saved as part of the exported sample data.

\item[Calculations\submenu Clear calculations] de-selects all the points
in all the selected samples, and clears the results of any calculations done
on them, such as \caps{pca} or great-circle analysis.

\item[Calculations\submenu Fit circle] calculates and displays a
best-fitting great circle for all the selected points in all the selected
samples.

\item[Calculations\submenu Great circles] calculates a best-fitting
direction for all the great circles fitted at the current site,
using the algorithm of \cite{mcfadden1988circles}. The great-circle fit
is shown both in the \ppcmd{Great circles} plot in the main window
(if the plot has been activated in the preferences), and in
a separate window which is opened automatically.

\item[Calculations\submenu Clear site calculations] clears the
results of any calculations associated with the selected {\em sites}
(as opposed to samples); at present, this amounts to clearing the
best-fit great-circle direction for each selected site.

\item[Calculations\submenu Reversal test] performs a basic reversal
test of {\em all} the currently open suites.

\paragraph{\caps{Ams} calculations}

PuffinPlot can show the results of statistical calculations on \caps{ams}
tensors, giving mean directions and confidence ellipses for the principal
axes by one of three methods; at present, however, these calculations cannot
be performed by PuffinPlot itself. Instead, it makes use of two Python
scripts from the PmagPy suite \citep[tauxe2010paleomagnetism],
\ppcmd{bootams.py} and \ppcmd{s\_hext.py}. In order to calculate \caps{ams}
statistics, these scripts must first be installed on the computer running
PuffinPlot, and the folder containing them must be specified in the
\ppcmd{Preferences} window. The PmagPy programs may be obtained from

All \caps{ams} calculations operate on the currently selected samples.
\cite{tauxe1998directions} and chapter 13 of \cite{tauxe2010paleomagnetism}
give more details of tensor statistics, particularly with regard to the
application of bootstrap methods.

\begin{menuitemlist}

\item[Calculations\submenu Calculate bootstrap \caps{ams}] calculates
bootstrap statistics using the \ppcmd{bootams.py} program, producing
Kent error ellipses which are shown on the \caps{ams} plot in the main
window.

\item[Calculations\submenu Parametric bootstrap \caps{ams}] calculates
bootstrap statistics using the \ppcmd{bootams.py} program, producing Kent
error ellipses which are shown on the \caps{ams} plot. It differs from the
previous function in employing a parametric bootstrap, which can provide more
realistic confidence intervals for small numbers of samples on the (often
reasonable) assumption that measurement uncertainties are normally
distributed across the selected samples.

\item[Calculations\submenu Calculate Hext on \caps{ams}] calculates
\cite[hext1963tensors] statistics using the \ppcmd{s\_hext.py} program
and displays the mean directions and error ellipses on the \caps{ams} plot.

\item[Calculations\submenu Clear \caps{ams} calculations] Clears
any previously done bootstrap and Hext calculations.
