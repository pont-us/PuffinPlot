PuffinPlot's current graphics export options are a little unsatisfying:
there are two options each for PDF and SVG export, since I added FreeHEP
export when a reviewer of the PuffinPlot paper complained about problems
with vector export using Batik and iText. We thus have three different
libraries which between them produce two different variants of each
format. Clearly it would be better to have one well-tested, *reliable*
export option for each format. It would also be good to add EPS export,
which might be more reliable than PDF or SVG for import into Adobe
Illustrator.

There are a couple of promising vector export libraries which might
solve some of these problems: jfreesvg and vectorgraphics2d. The
first only exports SVG; the second, PDF, SVG, and EPS. Both of them
are free software, and both are very compact compared to the current
libraries -- this gives me a better chance of being able to correct
any deficiences myself, since the source code will be more navigable
than e.g. Batik. (It will also cut PuffinPlot's download size a bit,
but most of the bulk is Jython so the overall effect won't be huge.)

For EPS export there is also http://www.abeel.be/wiki/EPSGraphics and
https://github.com/matmas/java-eps-graphics

It would also be worth doing a more thorough web search for other
options: evidently a lot has happened in this domain since I last
evaluated the available libraries.
