title: Add a Vec3Path class
desc: |-
  Vec3 contains a number of static methods which operate on 
  sequences of vectors. These would probably be better handled by
  a new companion class which acts as a wrapper around an ordered
  list of vectors and permits operations on them. This might also
  make it easier to keep vector paths immutable, if this proves
  to be a worthwhile endeavour.
