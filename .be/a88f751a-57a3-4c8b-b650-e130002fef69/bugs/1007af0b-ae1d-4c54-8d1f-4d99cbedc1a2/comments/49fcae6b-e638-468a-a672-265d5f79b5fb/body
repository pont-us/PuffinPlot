Automatic site recalculation now implemented; with luck this
might also improve things for the user who reported 
a88/c74 "Site param table doesn't update" (currently 
irreproducible). Automatic suite recalculation not implemented,
since suite calculations operate on currently selected samples,
so an automatic recalculation might change which samples/sites
are included in the suite statistics.
