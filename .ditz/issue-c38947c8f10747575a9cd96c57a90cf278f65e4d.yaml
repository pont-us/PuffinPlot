title: Make depth selection more robust
desc: |-
  Currently samples in a long core are kept in a hash table with
  Doubles representing depths as the keys. This seems to work but
  is a little dodgy, given the inherent imprecision of floating-
  point arithmetic. Would it make more sense simply to treat depth
  labels as strings, since they're only accessed by index anyway?
  This would let long core and discrete suites be handled far more
  uniformly.
