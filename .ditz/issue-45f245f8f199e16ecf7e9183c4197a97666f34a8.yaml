title: Great Circle confidence intervals too small
desc: |-
  There seems to be a problem with alpha-95 values calculated
  from great-circle intersection. They are implausibly small,
  and do not match the larger values calculated by starmac
  (although the rest of PP's calculation is in agreement with 
  starmac).

    A calculation error meant that PuffinPlot was producing 5%
    confidence intervals rather than 95%! Now fixed.
