I've now done some of the heavy lifting on this while implementing
support for loading JR6 files. Since these support free choice of any
Agico orientation convention, I had to implement OrientationParameters
and VectorAndOrientations to convert them to PuffinPlot's convention, so
these are now available for handling the orientation conventions
anywhere else that they're required. The obvious first target would be
AMS ASC import, which currently simply assumes a PuffinPlot-compatible
orientation convention -- though nobody's complained about that yet.

To date, I don't recall anyone asking for support for variant
orientation conventions during actual data processing in PuffinPlot, so
maybe converting on import (from JR6 or anything else that uses these
conventions) is sufficient.
