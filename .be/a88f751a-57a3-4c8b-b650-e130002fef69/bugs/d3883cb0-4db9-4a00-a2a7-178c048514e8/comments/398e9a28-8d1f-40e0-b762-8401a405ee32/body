Anonymous reviewer says:
‘I do prefer to use dip direction and dip for bedding and other
planar attitudes- however this is not universally the case- so a
toggle option to use either strike and dip, or dip direction and
dip, would be useful. Likewise, our lab uses azimuth and hade,
rather than azimuth and plunge, for core orientation- so a toggle
for either of those formats would also be a good additional
feature.’
Shouldn't be too hard.
