Magnetic susceptibility units are a hard problem: the conversion
factor is potentially different for every set-up, and is probably
best determined empirically. I've added a ‘scale mag. sus.’ feature,
which places the onus on the user since there's no way PuffinPlot
can deduce the correct factor from the data files themselves.
This means that there is nothing more to to be done on the SI
front so I'm closing this ticket.
