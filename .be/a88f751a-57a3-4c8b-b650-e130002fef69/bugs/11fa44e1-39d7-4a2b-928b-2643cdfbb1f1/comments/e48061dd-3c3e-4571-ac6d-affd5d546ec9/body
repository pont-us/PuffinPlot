This turns out on closer inspection to be not one issue but several.

1. Offset point fills seem to be an OS X bug; opened separately as #56.
2. Jagged confidence ellipses are a result of using java.awt.Polygon,
   which uses integer coordinates. I will try substituting GeneralPath
   which should fix it.
3. All the other drawing, as far as I know, uses float or double co-
   ordinates, so we shouldn't need to scale it up to get accuracy.
