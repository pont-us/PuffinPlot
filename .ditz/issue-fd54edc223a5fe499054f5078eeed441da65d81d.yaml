title: Refactor the corrections architecture
desc: |-
  the Correction class and its usage are a bit of a mess -- passed
  around between PuffinApp, PrefsWindow, and CorrectionWindow.
  Includes dead code for old-style tray and empty-slot corrections --
  this should be excised -- it can always be re-added one day if
  required.
