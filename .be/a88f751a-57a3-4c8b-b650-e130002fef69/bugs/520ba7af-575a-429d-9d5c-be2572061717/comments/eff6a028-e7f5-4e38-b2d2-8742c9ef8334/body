Requested by Christian after experiences on the JOIDES. Fundamentally,
all that's needed for analysis is a series of 3-dimensional vectors,
so it's a shame that Puffin is tied to the extremely specific OPRF/2G
input format (complete with misspelling of `Azimuth'). Puffin should
accept another, stripped-down format which could be as simple as x/y/z 
but should also have room for e.g. sample code and demag level. This
would also force me to think about what fields are actually necessary in
the full 2G files, allowing malformed files to be rejected on loading
rather than causing a crash at the display stage.
