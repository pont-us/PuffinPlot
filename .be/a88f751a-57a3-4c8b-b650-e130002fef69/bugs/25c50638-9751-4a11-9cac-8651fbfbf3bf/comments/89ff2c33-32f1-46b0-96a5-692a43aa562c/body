The code for printing, PDF export, and SVG export has grown in
a somewhat ad-hoc fashion and probably needs a little tidying up
and refactoring. Among other things, it's not clear that double
buffering is disabled in all the vector export routines. So far I've
never come across any evidence of accidental double-buffering (e.g.
a huge bitmapped PDF export) but it's probably worth doing the due
diligence.
