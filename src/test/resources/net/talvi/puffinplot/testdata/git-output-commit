Add a fromGitOutput factory method to Version

Currently, a Version object is instantiated at run time from properties
which the Ant build process sets from git output. I have now added a
Version::fromGitOutput factory method which instantiates a Version
directly from the git output, allowing its post-processing to be moved
from build time to run time. At present, the raw git output is not written
at build time and the fromGitOutput factory method is therefore not yet
used. Its main purpose is to ease the future transition from Ant to Maven,
since the latter makes it more difficult to do this kind of processing at
build time.
