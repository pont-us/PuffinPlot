title: Clip PCA lines on Zplot
desc: |-
  I suspect that PCA line projections on the Zplot are still relying
  on the window clip area for truncation, meaning that they're
  far too long when exported or printed. Look into this and clip
  them explicitly if necessary.

    Looks as though this was already fixed some time ago -- there is
    definitely an explicit clip being applied in ZPlot.drawLine, and it 
    seems to be fine in PDF and SVG exports as tested by both me and 
    Faye. The only niggle is that the PCA line can sometimes overwrite
    the window scroll bars, but this is relatively minor. I'll open a 
    new bug for it.
