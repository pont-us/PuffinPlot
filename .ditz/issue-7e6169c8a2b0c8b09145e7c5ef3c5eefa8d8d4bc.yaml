title: Allow user to set treatment type
desc: |-
  Treatment type is not, alas, always specified in the input file.
  It is probably impossible to construct a 100% reliable heuristic
  to guess it in these cases. For file where the treatment type is
  unspecified or incorrect, it would be useful to have a feature
  whereby the user can set it manually.
