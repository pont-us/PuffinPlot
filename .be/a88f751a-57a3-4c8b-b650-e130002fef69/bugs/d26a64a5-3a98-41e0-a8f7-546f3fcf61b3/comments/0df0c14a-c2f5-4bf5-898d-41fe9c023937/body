Currently PP uses an imperfect heuristic to work out whether
the SQUIDs are in their old or new orientations. We should be more
up-front about this to avoid invisible errors. Add a user preference.
Needs a little thought now that saving is implemented, since the
SQUID flipping is done on load. Time to expand the file format beyond
the 2G template, perhaps?
