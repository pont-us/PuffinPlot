title: Generalize input format
desc: |-
  Requested by Christian after experiences on the JOIDES. Fundamentally,
  all that's needed for analysis is a series of 3-dimensional vectors,
  so it's a shame that Puffin is tied to the extremely specific OPRF/2G
  input format (complete with misspelling of `Azimuth'). Puffin should
  accept another, stripped-down format which could be as simple as x/y/z 
  but should also have room for e.g. sample code and demag level. This
  would also force me to think about what fields are actually necessary in
  the full 2G files, allowing malformed files to be rejected on loading
  rather than causing a crash at the display stage.
