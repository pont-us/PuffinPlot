The units for PuffinPlot's internal data representation are at present
implicitly defined as `whatever comes out of the 2G software'. They
should be well-defined as the appropriate SI units, and converted on
loading from whichever file format is being imported.
(Original description was:
These need to be explicitly represented at some point, to allow for
cgs/si conversions in PuffinPlot, loading from datafiles with different
conventions, etc.)
