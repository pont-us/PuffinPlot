Seems to be due to the unicode lower-case alpha character in the
line -- falling back to default font if Helvetica doesn't contain
the character? Changing the alpha to an `a' fixes the problem but it's
rather shoddy to make that substitution. I think this could be solved
by using an AttributedString with an explicit font change after the
alpha.
