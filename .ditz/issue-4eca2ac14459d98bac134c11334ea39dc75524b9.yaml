title: Tidy up protocol selection in preferences
desc: |-
  At the very least I should make the tooltip more polite!
  Also clearly a combo box would be more appropriate than a text field.
  (Also maybe it should be presented on file loading, though that's
  probably a different bug.)

    Protocol selection is now by combo box with a 
    sensible tooltip.
