On consideration, the options of course can't be supplied via the
constructor, because getOptionDefinitions is an instance method. Also,
plots already have a basic general-purpose options API, in the form of the
getSetting and getSettingBoolean methods in the PlotParams interface. This
could be harmonized the the FileLoader options scheme by replacing them
both with a generalized getOption(String, Object) to be used in
accordance with a getOptionDefinitions implementation by the plot.
This would allow getCorrection and the get*axis methods in PlotParams
to be replaced with options defined by ZPlot.
