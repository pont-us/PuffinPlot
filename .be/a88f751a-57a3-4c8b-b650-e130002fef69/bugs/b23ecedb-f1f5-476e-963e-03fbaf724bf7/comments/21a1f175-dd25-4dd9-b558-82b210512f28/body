I should consider implementing PDF and SVG export within PuffinPlot
itself. At first sight this seems insanely laborious -- it would 
indeed be laborious, but the labour would be far less than that 
required to implement full SVG and PDF export libraries -- after
all, PuffinPlot uses only a tiny subset of the full specifications
of these formats.

Probably, the way to go would be to create an internal API for all
PuffinPlot's graphics operations -- really not much more than lines,
text, and outlined and filled polygons and circles. Then just write
back-ends that plug into the interface. A lot of boilerplate, but
the benefits would be a much smaller executable size, faster export,
more compact and well-structured exported files, and (most 
importantly) full control over the file format. No more trying
to second-guess how iText et al. are going to deal with various
Graphics2D calls.
