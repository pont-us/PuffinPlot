title: Produce stand-alone manual
desc: |-
  I have now written the PuffinPlot manual, but it is currently
  inconveniently incarnated as an appendix in my thesis. I need to
  get the content into a stand-alone form, preferably one that can
  be processed to both PDF and HTML.

    The path of least resistance seems to be to convert (and update)
    the manual from the thesis to MarkDown (by hand), then use that
    as the source format to produce HTML, PDF and whatever else is
    needed. ConTeXt-to-HTML is possible but hard compared to pandoc.
    We lose some typographical beauty but I think maintaining a 
    ConTeXt version would take too much time and effort.

    Manual translated to LaTeX and added to repository. Compiles
    under pdflatex and htlatex. Still need to think about best way
    to distribute it.
