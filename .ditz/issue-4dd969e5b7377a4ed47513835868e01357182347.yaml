title: Label plot frames when moving plots
desc: |-
  In "move mode", plot frames should be labelled with the name of
  the plot, because it's not always obvious what they are. For example,
  If no PCA has been performed, the "PCA table" plot will be completely
  blank.

    Implemented as described. Also added a feature whereby smaller plots
    are preferentially selected for dragging when an area of overlap is
    clicked on by the user. This makes it easier e.g. to position the 
    PCA values table atop the Zplot.
