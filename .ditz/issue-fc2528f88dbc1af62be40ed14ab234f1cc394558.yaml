title: AMS import does not work with some files
desc: |-
  PuffinPlot's AMS file import was developed for the Safyr 2.6 file
  format. It fails to import Safyr 1.5 and Susar 4.0 files due to
  minor formatting differences. The import function should be improved
  to support these files, and the documentation improved to state the
  file versions with which PuffinPlot has been tested.

    AMS import now tested and working with SAFYR 2.6, SAFYR 1.5, and
    SUSAR 4.0 files. The AMS loader class is also better documented,
    and performs more explicit checks on the data to catch invalid files
    before they have a chance to cause an error.
