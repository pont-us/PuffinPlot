If a DAT file is opened and "Save" is subsequently selected, the 
PuffinPlot file will be saved over the original DAT. It would be 
better to treat opening a DAT as an "import", and not use it to set
the current filename. Selecting "Save" after opening a DAT file should
thus prompt for a new filename.
