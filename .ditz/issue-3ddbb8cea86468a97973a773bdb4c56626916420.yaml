title: Put frames around floats in manual
desc: |-
  In the PDF version of the manual, the tables and figure captions
  are hard to distinguish from the text. It would be better to
  put a frame around floats. the float package seems promising for
  this, but I haven't got it to work yet -- possibly an interaction
  with one of the 18 other packages I'm using.

    I haven't used frames as such. For figures I've ased the float 
    package with the ruled style, which places rules above and below
    the figure, and above the caption. I haven't done anything for
    tables because they have top and bottom rules anyway so don't
    really blend into the text much. For table 3, which has a large 
    note within the float itself at the bottom, I've added a full-width
    horizontal rule at the bottom. As it turns out, this extra height
    actually kicks the table onto its own page, which solves the 
    problem rather more conclusively than intended...
