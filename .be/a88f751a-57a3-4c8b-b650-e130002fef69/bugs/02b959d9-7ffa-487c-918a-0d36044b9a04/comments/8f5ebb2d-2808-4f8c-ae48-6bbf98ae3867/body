Implemented as specified. On a custom import, a warning is issued
if only inclination and declination are specified, stating that
intensities will be set to 1. If insufficient data is given for
a three-dimensional direction (i.e. import format contains neither
x+y+z nor inc+dec) the user is warned that all magnetization vectors
will be set to zero. Note that no warnings are given if fields are
specified but unreadable: in this case they just default to zero.
