title: Better feedback to user on importing malformed files
desc: |-
  If an imported file doesn't contain enough data to construct a
  vector for each demagnetization step, PuffinPlot will just quietly
  work with what it has, even if it's all defaulting to zero. It should
  warn the user that the imported data is incomplete, in case they 
  have made a mistake in specifying the import fields.

    Implemented as specified. On a custom import, a warning is issued
    if only inclination and declination are specified, stating that
    intensities will be set to 1. If insufficient data is given for
    a three-dimensional direction (i.e. import format contains neither
    x+y+z nor inc+dec) the user is warned that all magnetization vectors
    will be set to zero. Note that no warnings are given if fields are
    specified but unreadable: in this case they just default to zero.
