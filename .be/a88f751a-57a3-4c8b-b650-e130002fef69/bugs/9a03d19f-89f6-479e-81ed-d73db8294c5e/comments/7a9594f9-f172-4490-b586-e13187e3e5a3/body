So far two users (Christian and Bruce McFadden) have expressed a
need to use PuffinPlot for simple directional data (presumably 
sample directions obtained from a different program). PuffinPlot 
doesn't currently allow this: even the custom import dialog will
read every line of the file as a demagnetization point. I can 
envisage a somewhat unpleasant hack involving flipping directions,
anchored PCA to "promote" step directions to sample directions, etc.
but it's probably better to do it properly. Shouldn't be too hard
but there are probably a few places in the code where I assume that
there will be at least one demagnetization step associated with a
sample.
