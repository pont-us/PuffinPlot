title: Set PCA anchoring per sample
desc: |-
  PCA anchoring should be a sample property, since different samples
  within the same suite can have demagnetization chaarcteristics
  calling for either anchoring or no anchoring. Currently anchoring
  is specified on PCA recalculation and must thus be explicitly specified
  every time. This loses information when recalculating for a whole
  batch of samples.
