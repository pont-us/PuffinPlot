title: Fix plot resizing
desc: |-
  Currently plot resizing is non-intuitive (boxes don't appear until you
  drag) and buggy (you can drag graphs "inside-out" at which point resizing
  no longer works).

    Added a "move plot mode" which makes it much clearer when and how
    plots can be moved and resized.
