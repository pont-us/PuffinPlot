  - "Perhaps the easiest way to tie this one up for now -- without\n\
    losing any current functionality -- would be to implement another\n\
    SuiteCalcs object, but for all the loaded suites. The calculations\n\
    could be saved as for the other types of calculation, which would\n\
    probably be more useful than the current modal dialog implementation.\n\
    I would open \xE2\x80\x98implement proper reversals test\xE2\x80\x99 as a new bug\n\
    for a future version."

    Actually, it would make more sense to keep this bug open 
    (but deferred to a future release) for a proper reversals test,
    and open another ticket to tick off the partial functionality
    of multi-suite means.

    Issue #213 now represents a stop-gap for this feature
    (more sensible multi-suite means, but no explicit reversals test),
    so I am deferring the actual reversals test to a future release.
