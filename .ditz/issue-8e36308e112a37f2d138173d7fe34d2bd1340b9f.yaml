title: Move most preferences to Suite?
desc: |-
  It seems that all the preferences except maybe plot layout would
  be more sensibly housed in the Suite than in PuffinPlot. This would
  finally force a file format evolution, since they need to be saved,
  and could be usefully combined with bumping various other things,
  like sample ID or magnetic deviation, up from Datum to Sample or Suite.
