title: Make `Fisher by site' more flexible with site prefixes
desc: |-
  `Fisher by site' calculation currently assumes that site code is
  the first two characters, and groups PCA values accordingly. Claudio
  prefixes his sample names with a suite code, so whole sample name
  looks like AB0101.1 rather than 0101.1 -- thus Puffin assumes that 
  everything is in one site!
  
  This could be easily fixed by using all but the last three characters as
  the site code, rather than the first two characters.
