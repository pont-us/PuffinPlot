Now partially implemented. Realized during implementation that
MS values can simply be folded into the (inferred) corresponding
remanence Datum objects, since a 2G MS line contains no valid
fields except for the sample name and MS reading (I think). This
should simplify a lot of things.

A couple of rough edges (autoscaling; not showing MS axis when
there's no data) remain.
