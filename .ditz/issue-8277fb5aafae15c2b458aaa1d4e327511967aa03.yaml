title: Tidy up `flip sample' feature
desc: |-
  This was added ad hoc to correct one of my mis-loaded samples;
  it's a bit arbitrary that only one axis is supported. I should support
  all three axes, or none!
type: :feature
component: PuffinPlot
release: "1.0"
reporter: Pontus Lurcock <pont@talvi.net>

    This needs fixing before first public release, even if
    only by removing it.

    All three axes now flippable, and the user gets a confirmation
    dialog to avoid accidentally messing up data.
