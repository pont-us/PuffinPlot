title: Automatically determine palaeocurrent direction
desc: "Anonymous Reviewer said:\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98One comment on the AMS data would be to provide a way to determine a\n\
  paleocurrent direction and to save those (this could be very useful in a\n\
  stratigraphic context).\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  A simple implementation of this wouldn't actually be very hard --\n\
  just pull out the declination of the major AMS axis and add it to\n\
  the sample data export."
