title: Make PuffinPlot scriptable
desc: |-
  Hard work but the rewards would be tremendous. A command console in the
  running program to perform custom manipulations en masse. A headless
  batch mode allowing PP to be incorporated into a publication build
  script. Groovy is an obvious choice for language, but ruby seems well-
  regarded for constructing simple DSLs.
  
  Probably too time-consuming ever to be implemented, but nice to have
  on the wishlist. (Actually, would be easy to do as Groovy hooks 
  straight into the Puffin's guts; the hard bit would be designing
  a DSL simple enough for people to use without intimate knowledge of
  PP's internals.)

    Given Python's popularity with the scientific and particularly pmag
    crowd, jython might be the best choice -- it was stagnant for a long
    time but 2.5 has recently come out. See
    http://wiki.python.org/jython/UserGuide#embedding-jython
    org.python.util.PythonInterpreter
    org.python.util.ReadlineConsole
    (also JLineConsole and InteractiveInterpreter in same package)

    This has now mostly been implemented as #176, with a bundled
    Jython interpreter. However, I can't close it yet, as PuffinPlot
    still lacks an interactive console ( http://don.freeshell.org/jython/
    currently looks like a promising candidate, though).
