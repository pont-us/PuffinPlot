Fisher means are now handled almost as fully as PCA directions.
They are displayed in plots and used in site- and suite-level means,
and documented in the manual. However, they are not currently saved
as part of a PuffinPlot file. This would be a little awkward to
implement and unless there is urgent demand it would be more
reasonable to leave it until I implement support for multiple fits
per sample (issues #247 and #259).
