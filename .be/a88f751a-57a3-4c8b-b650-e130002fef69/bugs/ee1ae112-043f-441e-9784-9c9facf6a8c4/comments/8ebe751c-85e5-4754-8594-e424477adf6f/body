Currently most imported data fields are expected to be in whatever
units PuffinPlot uses internally -- which means Tesla for AF
demagnetization fields, and A/m for sample remanences. These units need
to be selectable by the user during importing, to allow (for example)
demagnetization fields in mT and remanences in Gauss. Reported by
Terence Day.
