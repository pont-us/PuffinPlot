A problem that Christian described a while ago: if your
demagnetization steps aren't uniform across the suite, copying
point selections is a problem since the same sequential set
of steps won't correspond to the same actual range of treatment
intensities. So we need an interface for (1) selecting a user-
specified treatment intensity range or (2) copying the intensity
range from the current sample and applying it to the selection
or (3) both.
