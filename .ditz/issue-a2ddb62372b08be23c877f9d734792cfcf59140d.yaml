title: Use AMS data to determine mag. sus. scaling
desc: |-
  If there is imported AMS data, it should include a bulk susceptibility
  measurement in S.I. units. This could be used to scale the Bartington
  loop measurements. Perhaps just add a "guess from AMS" button on the
  "rescale mag. sus." dialog.
