title: Macro recording / script building / undo
desc: |-
  Although PuffinPlot has a scripting mode, it's not really coupled 
  to interactive operation: it would be useful to produce a script from
  an interactive session which would replay all that session's operations
  to recreate the same result. This would be an excellent way to ensure
  that results were reproducible, and to make PuffinPlot processing
  workflows inspectable. It could probably be done using some form of
  the GoF Command Pattern. Python seems like the most sensible choice
  for the scripts, since PuffinPlot already bundles the Jython 
  interpreter. This would also lay a foundation for undo/redo in 
  PuffinPlot, although this would additionally require coding an inverse
  operation for each PuffinPlot command -- perhaps not worthwhile until
  some demand for undo/redo has been demonstrated.
