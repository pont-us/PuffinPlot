title: Put frames around floats in manual
desc: |-
  In the PDF version of the manual, the tables and figure captions
  are hard to distinguish from the text. It would be better to
  put a frame around floats. the float package seems promising for
  this, but I haven't got it to work yet -- possibly an interaction
  with one of the 18 other packages I'm using.
