title: Allow range selection for long cores
desc: |-
  Long cores really need to be on a par with discrete suites in terms
  of multiple sample selection. Unfortunately a standard JSlider can't
  do this; there are third-party range sliders available but
  implementing my own is probably the easiest, since I don't actually
  need much functionality. Most intuitive way would probably two
  adjacent vertical strips, one showing the `pointer' (current sample),
  the other the range (if any).
