Problem encountered on Windows XP: Batik SVG file is malformed
and will not open in Firefox or Inkscape. Reason appears to be
that, although the encoding is declared as UTF-8, the single
non-ASCII character in the file (the degree symbol in the 
demagnetization plot x-axis label) is encoded as ISO-8859-1.
