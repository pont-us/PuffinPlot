OK, seems that provided we have Java 6 on OS X 10.6, superscript
rendering finally works. I've retested the workaround on 
OS X 10.5.8 / Java 1.5 / PPC (works) and proper superscripting on
OS X 10.6 / Java 1.6 / Intel (also works). PuffinPlot will
now use proper superscripting on OS X provided that OS X >= 10.6
and Java >= 1.6.
