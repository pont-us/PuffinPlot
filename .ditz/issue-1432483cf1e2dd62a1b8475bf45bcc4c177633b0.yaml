title: Improve UI for site and suite calculations
desc: |-
  Both the anonymous reviewer and Christian report some confusion
  in doing site calculations. Site and suite parameter tables are a
  good start but I need to think about how I can give the user more
  control over and feedback on the calculation process. Would manual
  selection of samples and sites be helpful (as an optional override
  to the current automatic system)?
