Consider the following crafted file:

depth   demag   dec     inc     int
1       0       45      45      3
1       1       45      45      2
1       2       45      45      1

Import it using the tabular file importer with 3-axis AF demag.
The demag. of the first point comes up as NaN, which means that
it isn't plotted on the on-screen display, and is plotted in a
ludicrous place on the exported graphics files.
