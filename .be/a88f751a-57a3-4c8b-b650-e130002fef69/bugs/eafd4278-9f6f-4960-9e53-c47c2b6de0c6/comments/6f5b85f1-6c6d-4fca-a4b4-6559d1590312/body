It should be possible to generate a script from the current state of
PuffinPlot, without logging all the user's actions. Just loop through
all current datum objects, samples, and sites, churning out commands to
produce whatever selections and calculations are currently present,
then export all the calculations. If it's OK to generate from the 
PuffinPlot file we can archive that with the script. If not, things get
a little trickier since we need to archive the original files and
"replay" any relevant import options. Prefs file also needs to be
exported and archived.
