‘One comment on the AMS data would be to provide a way to determine a
paleocurrent direction and to save those (this could be very useful in a
stratigraphic context).’
A simple implementation of this wouldn't actually be very hard --
just pull out the declination of the major AMS axis and add it to
the sample data export.
