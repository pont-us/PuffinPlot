title: Redo the 2G file loader
desc: |-
  2G file loader is the right place to have things like
  sensor lengths and measurement protocol. Christian also wants it
  to be able to recalculate the moments from the ind/dec/int data,
  since the file doesn't (I believe) store the sensor-length-corrected
  cartesian components of the moment.
