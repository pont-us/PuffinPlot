The Apple equivalent of a * in the title bar seems to be the the
Window.documentModified client property, documented at
http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2007/tn2196.html#WINDOW_DOCUMENTMODIFIED .
On Macs, the menu title should also flash briefly when a hotkey is
pressed, which would also give useful visual feedback that saving is
taking place. But this isn't implemented in Apple Java and I can't think
of any way to work around it.
http://lists.apple.com/archives/Java-dev/2008/Nov/msg00239.html seems
to confirm this.
