title: Display site calculations within PuffinPlot
desc: |-
  Christian says: would be good to display the site calculations
  when they are finished. This would enable a trial and error
  process as well as an assessment of whether the site orientation
  is believable or whether a rethink is needed.

    Need to talk to Christian about how this should work in practice --
    e.g. where will it be displayed?

    Perhaps start expanding the Fisher Stats window into a more general
    `per-suite information' graph display, and implement a new DataTable
    for per-site Fisher stats?

  - "The former \xE2\x80\x98Fisher data\xE2\x80\x99 window now shows Fisherian parameters\n\
    for both the site Fisher-on-PCA calculation and the great-circle\n\
    intersection. (It can show both at once, though I expect that \n\
    this will seldom be necessary.)"
