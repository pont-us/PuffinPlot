title: General API for plot options
desc: |-
  It would be useful to have a system whereby a plot can declare
  which options it wants to read out of the preferences, and 
  PuffinPlot can automatically create GUI elements in the Preferences
  window for the user to modify them. (Number of buckets in NRM
  histogram, line tapering in equal-area plots, etc.) One complication:
  some plot options (such as the aforementioned number-of-buckets)
  would probably be better as suite-level rather than application-level
  preferences. Not a trivial job in any case.
