Took out the TextLayout, but I'm suspecting the original profiling
may have been dodgy since it only shaved a few percent off. Profiling
again shows fairly even division of painting time between the plots
and no obvious candidates for easy improvement (drawing points being
the most evident time sink). Anyway, the TextLayout has been replaced
with an AttributedCharacterIterator, with a FontMetrics to determine
the bounding box.
