title: Tidy up the extra equal-area plot windows
desc: "At present \xE2\x80\x98Fisher by site\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98Great circles\xE2\x80\x99 open up \n\
  new windows containing a single large equal-area plot.\n\
  These are at least partially redundant now that there are \n\
  site and suite equal area plots in the main window. Easiest\n\
  would probably be to retain them, but rename them (to \xE2\x80\x98site\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  and \xE2\x80\x98suite\xE2\x80\x99 something), and don't open them automatically.\n\
  Add the site (great-circle) plot to the Windows menu to\n\
  let it be opened automatically. They're still handy for\n\
  a quick close-up without having to edit the main plot layout."
