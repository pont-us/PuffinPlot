It would be useful to have a system whereby a plot can declare
which options it wants to read out of the preferences, and 
PuffinPlot can automatically create GUI elements in the Preferences
window for the user to modify them. (Number of buckets in NRM
histogram, line tapering in equal-area plots, etc.) One complication:
some plot options (such as the aforementioned number-of-buckets)
would probably be better as suite-level rather than application-level
preferences. Not a trivial job in any case.
