Now using Window.setIconImages. Seems fine on Windows. A bit 
ropey on Ubuntu but I don't think the problem there is at my end.
(Works fine from command line, default icon when run from file
manager. Very odd.) Suspect there's nothing I can do about it,
so I'm closing this bug and hoping that a future Ubuntu release will
fix the problem.
