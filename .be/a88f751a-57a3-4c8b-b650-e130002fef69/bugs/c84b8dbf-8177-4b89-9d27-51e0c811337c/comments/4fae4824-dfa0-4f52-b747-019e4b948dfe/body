I've just removed the menu items, but left the underlying code.
It's unlikely that tray corrections will become an on-the-fly item
again (with all the complex measurement protocols I've introduced),
but it's possible that a sensible implementation of the empty-slot
correction would apply it on-the-fly. In that case, there's no
reason not to let the user toggle it. So I'm leaving a code skeleton
to allow that, for now.
