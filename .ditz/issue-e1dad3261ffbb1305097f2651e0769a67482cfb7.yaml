title: Find a free graphic for the icon
desc: |-
  I can't remember where I got the current PuffinPlot icon, and
  I don't know whether it's freely useable. I need a free icon
  for the public release. http://search.creativecommons.org/ looks
  like a good place to start.

    I've found an out-of-copyright puffin picture by 
    Wilhelm von Wright and converted it to Mac icon format.
    Will close this bug as soon as I've tested it on a Mac.

  - Tested on Mac, seems to work OK.
