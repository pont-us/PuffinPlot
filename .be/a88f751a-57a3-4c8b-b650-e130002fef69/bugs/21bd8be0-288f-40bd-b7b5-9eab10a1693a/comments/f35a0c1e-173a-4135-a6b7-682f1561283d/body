I'm going to close this. There's no difficulty with implementing it in
principle: JAMA is public domain so I could even cut out the relevant
parts and paste them into PuffinPlot's source. However the benefit would
be negligible: JAMA is now <7.5% of Puffin's source, and even if
I drop Batik and FreeHEP for something smaller, Jython is still huge.
The changes would risk introducing new bugs, and the time is better
spent on more important improvements.
