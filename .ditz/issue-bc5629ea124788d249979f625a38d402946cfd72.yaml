title: Puffin clobbers DAT file when saving
desc: |-
  If a DAT file is opened and "Save" is subsequently selected, the 
  PuffinPlot file will be saved over the original DAT. It would be 
  better to treat opening a DAT as an "import", and not use it to set
  the current filename. Selecting "Save" after opening a DAT file should
  thus prompt for a new filename.
