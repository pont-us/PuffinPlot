Maybe a bit ambitious, but I just noticed that Gary Acton thinks
it's handy to have an animated GIF of demag data (each frame being
the plots for one depth). What about bundling up data & some code
for a minimal viewer applet -- essentially just the main window
and slider of PuffinPlot? Would be a nice way to share data.
Probably fairly niche use though, low priority.
