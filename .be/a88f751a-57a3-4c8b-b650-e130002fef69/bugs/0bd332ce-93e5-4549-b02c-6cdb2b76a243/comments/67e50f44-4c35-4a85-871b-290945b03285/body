Both "merge measurements" and "merge samples" features now implemented
and documented. "Merge samples" turns out seldom to be needed in
practice -- I think PuffinPlot has got better at combining treatment
steps into samples during loading since this bug was created. But
considering the ever-increasing number of ways to edit a suite, there
are doubtless still ways to end up with duplicate samples.
