title: Fix Zplot axis tick labels
desc: |-
  Units on ticks for Zplot axes: they are not shown, and they are
  independently chosen -- so you can get a graph with e.g. a "1.0"
  (with implicit e-7) on one axis, and a "5.0" (with implicit e-8)
  on another axis half as long!
  
  Units need to be standardized and displayed.
