title: Distinguish demag points from means on site EA plots
desc: "JMG writes:\n\
  Site stereonets show incremental sample demag directions for GC\n\
  fits \xE2\x80\x93 this is useful, but it is difficult to distinguish them\n\
  from sample means \xE2\x80\x93 it would be better if it displayed different\n\
  symbols to represent site means, sample best fits, and individual\n\
  sample steps (in the case of great circles)."
