title: Zplot import broken?
desc: |-

    Yes, I broke it when trying to make PuffinPlot behave more gracefully
    with broken files. It was throwing away the header line, then trying
    to read the first data line as headers -- oops! Have fixed & tested
    with the file Christian sent me; will wait for his OK before closing.
