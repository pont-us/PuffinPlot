    Seems to be due to the unicode lower-case alpha character in the
    line -- falling back to default font if Helvetica doesn't contain
    the character? Changing the alpha to an `a' fixes the problem but it's
    rather shoddy to make that substitution. I think this could be solved
    by using an AttributedString with an explicit font change after the
    alpha.
