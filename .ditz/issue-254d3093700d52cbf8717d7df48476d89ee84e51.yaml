title: Make Zplot file loading more robust
desc: |-
  Very trivial, but this should be fixed: the line
  String[] headers = whitespace.split(reader.readLine());
  (currently line 357) in Suite.java will break if the file is too short
  and readLine() returns null. Should hardly ever happen but worth trapping
  anyway.
