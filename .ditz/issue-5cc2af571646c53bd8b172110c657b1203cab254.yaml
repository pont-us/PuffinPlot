title: Tidy up preferences architecture
desc: |-
  Previously I tried to keep all preferences in PuffinPrefs, and it
  was a pain to keep them in sync with the user controls. Now PuffinPrefs
  asks classes to save their own preferences (e.g. GraphDisplay's plot
  sizes). But there are still vestigial uglinesses like PuffinPrefs's
  copy of the correction value.
  
  Check that everything in PuffinPrefs should be there; if not, move or
  eliminate it.

    Perhaps the answer is a listener architecture, where other classes
    register with PuffinPrefs and are called back to save their preferences
    at the appropriate time.
