title: Mac superscript broken again
desc: |-

  tweak the Y offset to make it look better on the Mac? Probably not,
  but maybe worth trying.

    Need to set up a VNC server on Corelyser so that I can debug this

    Worked around, with an unpleasant but unavoidable hack which is
    thoroughly documented in a code comment. Tested on Corelyser, seems
    to work fine (at least until the next Apple Java update).
