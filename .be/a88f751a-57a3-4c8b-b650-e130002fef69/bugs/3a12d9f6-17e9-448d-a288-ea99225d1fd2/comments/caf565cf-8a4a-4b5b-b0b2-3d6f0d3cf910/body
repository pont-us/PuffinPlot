At present, SampleDataPanel destroys and recreates all its components
on every update, even if it's just an update to a different sample
within a Suite. Check whether this is taking significant time, and
if so, implement separate sample-update and suite-update functions,
with sample-update just updating the contents of the pre-existing 
components.
