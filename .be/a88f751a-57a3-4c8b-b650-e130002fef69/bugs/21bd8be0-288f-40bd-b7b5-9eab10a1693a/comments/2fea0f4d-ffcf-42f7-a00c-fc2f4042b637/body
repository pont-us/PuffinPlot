I have tidied things up a little by removing the JAMA source code from
the PuffinPlot repository and using a jar from Maven Central instead.
Now that Apache Commons Math is in any case a PuffinPlot dependency, it
would make sense in the longer term to drop JAMA entirely and use
Commons Math instead for eigenvectors. Commons Math is more actively
maintained than JAMA, and its matrix API is explicitly based on JAMA,
IIRC, so it shouldn't be a big job. But it's by no means urgent.
