Currently site codes are set purely by inference from
the sample name, assuming Otago naming conventions. If
PuffinPlot's going to be any use to anyone else, we need
the capability to set them explicitly! Should be pretty
simple. As well as a straight ‘set this site code for the
selected samples’ features, it would be good to have a
‘use this character range (from the sample name) as the
site code’ function.
