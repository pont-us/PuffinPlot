Now implemented in a simple fashion, though quite a lot of changes were
required even for this basic functionality. PuffinPlot now supports:
importing of directions to create samples without any demagnetization
data; plotting and analysis of imported directions in the same way as
"normal" (PCA and Fisher) sample directions; and saving and loading of
these directions in PuffinPlot files.

There's one notable omission: because sample and formation corrections
are applied at a Datum level, they have no effect on imported sample
directions. Fixing this would (I think) be a fairly large and delicate
job: the existing data model has to be kept for "normal" data, and the
corrections applied at the sample level *only* for the imported data.
It's not clear whether either of the original requesters actually
required this functionality, so for now I'm omitting it. Can always
open a new ticket and implement it if it's requested later.
