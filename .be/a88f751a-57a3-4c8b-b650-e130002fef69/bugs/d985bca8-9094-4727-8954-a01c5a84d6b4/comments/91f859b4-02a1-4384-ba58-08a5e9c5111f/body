PuffinPlot's AMS file import was developed for the Safyr 2.6 file
format. It fails to import Safyr 1.5 and Susar 4.0 files due to
minor formatting differences. The import function should be improved
to support these files, and the documentation improved to state the
file versions with which PuffinPlot has been tested.
