title: Data point fills are off on Mac printouts
desc: |-
  On Mac printouts, the fills for filled points are slightly offset
  up and to the left. Examination of the file shows that it's off by
  exactly half a PDF unit in each direction. Looks as though this is a
  Mac Java bug; should check on Java 6 if I can find a 64-bit Intel
  machine. Haven't thought hard about workarounds yet (shifting the fill
  to compensate is the obvious but nasty one!) -- in worst case, could
  output to PDF via a third-party library like Big Faceless, iText,
  or Batik.

    Reassigning since (1) I want to get 1.0 out soon (2) nobody's ever
    complained about it (3) fixing it will probably require either a
    really nasty hack or a really big workaround.
