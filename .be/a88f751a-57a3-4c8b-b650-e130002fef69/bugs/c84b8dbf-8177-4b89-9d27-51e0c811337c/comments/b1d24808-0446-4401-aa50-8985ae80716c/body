Empty-slot corrections need to be rethought and reimplemented,
and there's no time to do that for version 1.0. The best plan
is to remove at least the menu items (to avoid confusing users)
and probably the code too (since it's not currently used, and
since it would probably need re-writing and testing before
being useful); it'll be in the repo if I ever need it again 
anyway.
