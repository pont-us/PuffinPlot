title: Implement saving
desc: |-
  User needs to be able to save the whole current state -- loaded files,
  selections, calculations, etc. Obviously some careful thought needed
  about how to do this sensibly; it will probably involve packing up
  all the loaded files into a zip, with another file of metadata.

    PuffinPlot can now save an augmented 2G-style data table. This might
    need rethinking at a later date but for now it works.
