title: Crash when wrong 2G protocol selected
desc: |-
  To reproduce: select TRAY_NORMAL_YFLIP for 2G protocol in
  Preferences. Open a 2G file measured using a single-measurement
  protocol. Expected: PuffinPlot reports an error on reading the
  file and suggests than it might be caused by an incorrect protocol
  selection. Actual: Puffin crashes due to a "null line in readDatum"
  at TwoGeeLoader.java:269.

    of lines during multi-measurement-protocol file reading.
