title: Ensure ZplotLegend drawn after Zplot
desc: |-
  ZplotLegend needs to be drawn after its enclosing Zplot, since
  it has to read the axis data. Currently this is dependent on
  the iteration order of a HashMap, which happens to work on
  OS X and Linux, but crashes on Windows!

    Simple fix: changed the plots HashMap to a LinkedHashMap which 
    iterates in insertion order! Also robustified ZplotLegend to
    fail more gracefully if axes == null.
