title: `Show all points' shortcut doesn't work
desc: |-
  Christian reports that the "unhide quick key doesn't work". (ctrl-shift-
  G, or command-shift-G on Macs). Works fine on Linux. Could be related
  to (1) Macs being different (2) modifier key being different on Macs or
  (3) multiple modifier keys.

    I am unable to reproduce this on any platform. What's more, Christian
    is unable to reproduce it using the same hardware, installation, and
    data. Putting it down to cosmic rays, gremlins, or PEBKAC and closing.
