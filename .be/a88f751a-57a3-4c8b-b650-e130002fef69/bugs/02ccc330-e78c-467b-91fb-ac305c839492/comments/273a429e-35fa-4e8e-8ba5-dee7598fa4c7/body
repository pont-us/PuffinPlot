Just closed #64 as dupe of this. Adding #64's description and 
comment here since it contains some information not included in this
ticket:

Christian writes: "A cunning trick to teach the puffin plot would
be a 'find mid point' on intensity plots.  This would be great
for NRM and ARM plots. There are scripts out there that will do
this for you. I have not yet put in the effort to learn how they
work but have grand plans."

I wrote: "Probably straightforward, but need to discuss with
Christian to get an exact definition for `midpoint', a rationale
for doing it, and references for the algorithm.- edited
