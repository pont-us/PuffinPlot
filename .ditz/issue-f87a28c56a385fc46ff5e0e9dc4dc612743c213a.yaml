title: Implement conversion to SI units.
desc: |-
  The magnetometer reports everything (I think) in cgs, and currently
  PP plots it as such. It would be useful to be able to convert values
  to SI on the fly and plot them with the appropriate labels.

    Nearly done; just need to check what order of magnitude our
    magnetic susceptibility units are.

  - "Magnetic susceptibility units are a hard problem: the conversion\n\
    factor is potentially different for every set-up, and is probably\n\
    best determined empirically. I've added a \xE2\x80\x98scale mag. sus.\xE2\x80\x99 feature,\n\
    which places the onus on the user since there's no way PuffinPlot\n\
    can deduce the correct factor from the data files themselves.\n\
    This means that there is nothing more to to be done on the SI\n\
    front so I'm closing this ticket."
