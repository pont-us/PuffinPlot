title: More flexible export
desc: |-
  Really we need a fully customizable exporter to fit with the
  varied workflows that people have. Selectable fields, units, and
  separators. Shouldn't be too hard to bolt on to the existing framework,
  especially with virtual fields.

    This doesn't seem to be as important to people as I thought,
    perhaps because they're better at munging their own data than I
    suspected. Or perhaps everything they wanted really is in there
    already. In any case I'm dropping it from 1.0 to 1.1 since import
    flexibility is far more important and time is limited.
