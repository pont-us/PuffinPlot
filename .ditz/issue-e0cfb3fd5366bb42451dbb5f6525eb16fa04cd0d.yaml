    There's no perfect fix for this -- the conversion factor to
    S.I. can't be inferred from the data file. I've added a feature to
    let the user rescale the magnetic susceptibility data by a 
    specified value, which is probably the best that can be done.
    (Actually, if there's AMS data, that might be used to derive a scaling
    factor -- I will open this as a feature request.)
