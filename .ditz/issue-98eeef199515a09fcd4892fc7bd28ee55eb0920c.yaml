title: Problems with unanchored PCA
desc: "Gary Acton reports:\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98Neither the menu selection nor the Ctrl-R or Apple-R\n\
  allowed me to use the unanchored PCA.\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  A little baffling, since it works for everyone else.\n\
  My best guess is that he doesn't realize that \xE2\x80\x98Anchor PCA\xE2\x80\x99\n\
  is a toggle item which he must disable to get an unanchored PCA,\n\
  rather assuming that \xE2\x80\x98PCA\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98Anchor PCA\xE2\x80\x99 immediately\n\
  calculate anchored and unanchored PCAs respectively.\n\
  In this case, it's a problem of poor GUI design and/or poor \n\
  documentation. Probably the easiest fix would be to improve the\n\
  documentation, tool tips, and menu item wording."

  - "Note also that GA's next sentence commences\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98I noticed in the PuffinPlot manual that...\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    which shows that (if indeed this bug is due to misunderstanding\n\
    the GUI) the user did read the manual -- i.e. it's\n\
    an \xE2\x80\x98unclear documentation\xE2\x80\x99 problem rather than a \n\
    \xE2\x80\x98user didn't bother reading the documentation\xE2\x80\x99 problem."
