title: Add "merge measurements" feature
desc: |-
  Sometimes you can end up with two measurements for the same depth
  (or sample name) and demagnetization level in the same file. It
  would be useful to have a feature whereby these could be combined --
  either by taking the mean value or by discarding one measurement.
