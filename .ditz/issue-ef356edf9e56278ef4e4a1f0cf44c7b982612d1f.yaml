title: Control whether mag. dev. applied to corrections
desc: |-
  We need a configurable option (probably per-suite) which controls
  whether the local magnetic declination is applied to the sample and
  formation corrections.

    Controlling whether it's applied to the formation correction 
    probably sufficient -- after all, if you're not applying it
    to *anything*, you can just set it to zero. And I suspect that
    the case of wanting your formation correction corrected for
    local magnetic declination, but not your sample correction,
    is rare enough that I can ignore it.
