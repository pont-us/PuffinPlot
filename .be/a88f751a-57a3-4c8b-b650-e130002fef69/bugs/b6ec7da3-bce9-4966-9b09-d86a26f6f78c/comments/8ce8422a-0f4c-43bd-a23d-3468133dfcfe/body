Currently there are three textual components on the graph display:
1. Sample name and correction (anchored to top left)
2. PCA results (anchored to Z-plot)
3. Fisher results (anchored to equal area plot)

These should all be independently positionable like other plots.
(This will require variable-width margins since the current margin
sizes won't let them get small enough).
