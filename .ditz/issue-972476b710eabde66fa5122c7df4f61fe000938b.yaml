    This bug was introduced during the fixing of #266 -- PP was guessing
    Continuous if there was a Position field, even if there was also
    a Sample ID field. I have now modified the logic to guess as follows:
    Depth field -> continuous
    No Depth field, no Sample ID, but Position field present -> continuous
    All other cases -> discrete
    Of course this only takes effect when the measurement type is not
    explicitly specified. Ultimately the user should probably be queried
    in these cases, as I'm not sure that any heuristic will be 100%
    reliable.
