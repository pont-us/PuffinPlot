Looks as though this was fixed some time ago -- values are now displayed
inscientific notation and no overall OOM scaling is applied. Unsure
how to interpret C's last sentence there, but it seems to be a vague
notion rather than a definite feature request, so I'm closing this now
on the assumption that if he really wants a "self correcting feature"
he'll ask for it again, at which point I can ask him what he means.
(Asking him now, over email to the JOIDES Resolution, what he meant
5+ months ago would probably not be worthwhile.)
