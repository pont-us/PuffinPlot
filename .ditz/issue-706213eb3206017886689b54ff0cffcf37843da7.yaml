title: PuffinPlot crash on startup due to malformed build date
desc: |-
  This bug consists of two sub-bugs: (1) the build.hg.date in
  build.properties is sometimes blank. (2) PuffinPlot does not
  ignore this blank field as it should, but attempts to parse it
  as a Long and crashes on startup.

    Both sub-bugs fixed: build.xml modified to output date more reliably,
    and PuffinApp.java modified to deal gracefully with missing and
    malformed build dates.
