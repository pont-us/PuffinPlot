title: Incorrect character encoding in Batik SVG export
desc: |-
  Problem encountered on Windows XP: Batik SVG file is malformed
  and will not open in Firefox or Inkscape. Reason appears to be
  that, although the encoding is declared as UTF-8, the single
  non-ASCII character in the file (the degree symbol in the 
  demagnetization plot x-axis label) is encoded as ISO-8859-1.

    (Slight factual error: the multiplication symbol in a couple of
    plot legends is also a non-ASCII character.)

    GraphDisplay.saveSvgToBatik now explicitly requests UTF-8 encoding.
    I have successfully tested the fix under Windows.
