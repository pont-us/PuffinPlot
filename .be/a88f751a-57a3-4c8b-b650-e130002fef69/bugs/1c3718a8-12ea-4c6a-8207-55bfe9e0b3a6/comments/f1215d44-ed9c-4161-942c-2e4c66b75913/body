Tray corrections are applied after volume correction -- but since
tray correction is only available for discrete samples, and since
for discrete samples volume correction is the same in each axis,
it makes no difference whether the tray correction is applied before
or after it. The run number is no longer relevant since we've moved
to a sequential model of tray corrections, with the tray measurement
in the same file as the sample measurements.
