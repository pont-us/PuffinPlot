Magnetic susceptibility units can't be S.I.-ified automatically since
the scaling factor can vary between sensors. I've added a facility
to let the user scale the mag. sus. by a specified factor. Since 
the magnetic moment measurements have already been S.I.-ified, I 
am calling this bug fixed now.
