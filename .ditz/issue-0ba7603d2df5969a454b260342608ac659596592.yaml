title: Configurable PCA fit line
desc: |-
  I could partially address Reveiwer 2's problem with post-editing
  of PCA fit lines by adding a configuration option: something like
  "long/short/none", where "short" is truncated roughly to the fitted
  points rather than to the entire plot area.

  - I may as well add a colour chooser while I'm about it.

    First stage done: I've created an explicit clipping routine 
    (none in the Java libraries, alas) so we're no longer relying
    on setClip to truncate the lines (which caused problems with 
    vector export anyway).
