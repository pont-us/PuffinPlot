title: Allow hiding of points
desc: |-
  It should be possible to hide points from the plots, e.g. to avoid
  scaling a Zplot to a flux jump, or to ignore a mismeasurement
  superceded by a repetition at the same demagnetization level.
  Needs a little thought about getting the hidden points back, though.
