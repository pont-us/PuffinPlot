The path of least resistance seems to be to convert (and update)
the manual from the thesis to MarkDown (by hand), then use that
as the source format to produce HTML, PDF and whatever else is
needed. ConTeXt-to-HTML is possible but hard compared to pandoc.
We lose some typographical beauty but I think maintaining a 
ConTeXt version would take too much time and effort.
