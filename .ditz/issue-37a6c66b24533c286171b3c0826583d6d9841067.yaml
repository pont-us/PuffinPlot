title: Add a general-purpose biplot
desc: |-
  There are all kinds of useful biplots that might be performed:
  depth or sequence number vs. MDF, NRM, MAD-value etc., NRM vs MDF,
  etc. Would be good to have a configurable plot (either in main 
  plotting area or separate window) which can show these things.
