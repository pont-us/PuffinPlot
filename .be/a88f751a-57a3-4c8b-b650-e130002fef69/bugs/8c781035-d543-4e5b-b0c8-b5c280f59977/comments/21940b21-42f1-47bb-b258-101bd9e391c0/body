A plan for implementation: currently the Zplot is two overlaid
plots: a fixed horizontal plot with North always at the top,
and a vertical plot which always has Up at the top but has three
options for the horizontal axis (N/S, E/W, H). For now at least
I think the vertical-plot options are sufficient; maybe there are
occasions when you'd want Up at the bottom, or an inverted hz
axis on the vertical plot (N->S or E->W rather than S->N or W->E).
But I don't remember seeing these conventions used anywhere, so
I'll wait for someone to request them specifically. The thing we
definitely need is one more option for the currently fixed 
horizontal plot: west at the top and north at the right, to line
up the S->N axis with the corresponding vertical plot. So this
can actually be implemented independently of the existing
vertical-plot options, maintaining backwards compatibility of
preferences files, and with minimal changes to the existing UI.
Easiest would be just to add an option to the Preferences window,
though this makes it a bit of a pain for people who want to 
switch quickly between N,U/E,E and W,U/N,N plots. But maybe it
will suffice for a stopgap, since in the long term I want to
re-design the preferences/plots system anyway.
