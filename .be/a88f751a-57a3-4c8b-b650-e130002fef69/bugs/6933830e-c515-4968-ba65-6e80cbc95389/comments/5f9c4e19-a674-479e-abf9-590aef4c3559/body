If the Zplot is at the bottom or right edge of the main window, and 
the scroll bar is shown, the PCA lines (if shown) overwrite the scroll
bar. At present, the PCA lines are explicitly clipped to the ZPlot's
area. They also need to be clipped to the window's drawing area
(excluding the scroll bars) in order to avoid messing up the window
furniture.
