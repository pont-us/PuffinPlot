I seem to be having trouble when I re-fit a sample direction. The
program reverts to the original fit performed on a sample and
will not save the new fit. Perhaps I am doing something wrong?? I
hope its user error and that you can correct me -- As it stands,
I can't really make any progress with fitting data because of
this problem.
