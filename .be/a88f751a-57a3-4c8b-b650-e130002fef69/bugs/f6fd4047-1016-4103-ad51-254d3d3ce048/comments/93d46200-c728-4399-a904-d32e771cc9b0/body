Both the anonymous reviewer and Christian report some confusion
in doing site calculations. Site and suite parameter tables are a
good start but I need to think about how I can give the user more
control over and feedback on the calculation process. Would manual
selection of samples and sites be helpful (as an optional override
to the current automatic system)?
