title: Clean up after the name/depth unification
desc: |-
  Need to remove old references to `depth' where no longer used, and
  standardize a terminology -- probably `Sample ID', encompassing either
  depth or name. Replace `name' with `sample id' in contexts where it could
  also refer to a depth.
