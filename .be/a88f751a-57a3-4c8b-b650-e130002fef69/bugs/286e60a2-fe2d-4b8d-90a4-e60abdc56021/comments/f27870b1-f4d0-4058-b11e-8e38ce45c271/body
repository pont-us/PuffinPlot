A further request along these lines from Russ Burmester, 2014-12-14:

RB>> And probably difficult with the existing file structure, but it
RB>> would be handy to be able to save both anchored and free line fits
RB>> without having to use two separate files.

RB>> The aim of being able to save both free and anchored fits is so the
RB>> fits with the same points selected and means derived from them can
RB>> be compared. This is no problem if one is satisfied with the points
RB>> included in the fits because the file can be cloned. However, one
RB>> of the advantages of your program is that it is interactive and
RB>> begs to be used to play with and learn from different fits. Instead
RB>> of a new format to accommodate this, would it be possible to link
RB>> two data files to synchronize them?

PL> Interesting ideas -- the notion of linked data files got me
PL> thinking, and on reflection it might not be so hard to support
PL> multiple synchronized suites within the same file, with some quick
PL> mechanism for switching between them. Implementation would still be
PL> a big job but perhaps not as complex as supporting multiple fits at
PL> the sample level.
