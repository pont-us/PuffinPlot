title: Clean up after the name/depth unification
desc: |-
  Need to remove old references to `depth' where no longer used, and
  standardize a terminology -- probably `Sample ID', encompassing either
  depth or name. Replace `name' with `sample id' in contexts where it could
  also refer to a depth.

    Datum is now pretty unambiguous: it provides (get|set)(DiscreteId|Depth)
    and getIdOrDepth which switches on measurement type. `Sample ID' perhaps
    not such a good `ambiguous' designator, since it's used exclusively
    for discrete ID in the 2G file format. But nevertheless Suite is now
    using `samplesById' internally which is probably a good balance of
    conciseness and clarity.
