title: Fix Zplot axis tick labels
desc: |-
  Units on ticks for Zplot axes: they are not shown, and they are
  independently chosen -- so you can get a graph with e.g. a "1.0"
  (with implicit e-7) on one axis, and a "5.0" (with implicit e-8)
  on another axis half as long!
  
  Units need to be standardized and displayed.

    Interesting. Have been looking for some examples on this to see what
    best practice is on where to put units etc.. Seems that nobody
    bothers to specify units or even orders of magnitude on Zplots --
    at least not in the Tauxe lectures, Butler 1998, or Dunlop 1979.

    Fixing this triggered a major refactoring of the axis plotting code,
    which should stand me in good stead for any further changes. In absence
    of any good examples of layout, I've added the unit specification to
    the legend and the orders of magnitude to the axis tick labels. It will
    be easy to change if necessary.
