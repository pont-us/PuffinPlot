Selecting points
----------------

You can select a point, or deselect a selected point, by clicking on it 
with the left mouse button.

Holding down shift activates "sloppy selection mode": if you left-click
while holding shift, all points within a small radius of the pointer will 
be selected. If you right-click while holding shift, all points within
a small radius of the pointer will be deselected.


Corrections for sample and formation orientation and magnetic deviation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PuffinPlot will make use of the sample and formation corrections 
specified in its input file, but these values can be changed by selecting
one or more samples and choosing "Corrections..." from the Edit menu.
Select the corrections you'd like to change and enter the new values.

This window also allows you to apply a correction for magnetic deviation
to one or more samples.


Fisher calculations
-------------------

Fisher statistics can be calculated at three levels:

1. On selected points within individual samples.
2. On a per-site basis, using the PCA direction for each sample within
   the site. Sites are determined using the OPRF sample code convention
   whereby the first two digits of the sample code denote the site number.
3. On a per-suite basis, performing the calculation on every PCA value
   from every sample for which one has been calculated.


Saving calculations
-------------------

"sample" -> individual calculations for every sample or depth
"site" -> auto-grouped by site according to name
"suite" -> one value from the entire suite
