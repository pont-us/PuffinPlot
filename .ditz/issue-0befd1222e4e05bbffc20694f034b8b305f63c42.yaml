title: Sample re-fitting problems
desc: |-
  JMG writes:
  I seem to be having trouble when I re-fit a sample direction. The
  program reverts to the original fit performed on a sample and
  will not save the new fit. Perhaps I am doing something wrong?? I
  hope its user error and that you can correct me -- As it stands,
  I can't really make any progress with fitting data because of
  this problem.

    It's possible that this might be the same bug as #257 
    (cleared PCA calculations reappearing). Need to check back
    with JMG before I can do anything with this one.
