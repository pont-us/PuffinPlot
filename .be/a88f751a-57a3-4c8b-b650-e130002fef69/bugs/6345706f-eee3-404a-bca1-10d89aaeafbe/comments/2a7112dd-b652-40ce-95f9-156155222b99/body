PuffinPlot now uses several external libraries, which are
automatically wrapped up in the final jar. However, there's
no explicit documentation on where these libraries should be placed
so that they can be found by the NetBeans project. It can be
pieced together from the project file itself, but for someone
trying to build from scratch it would be good to have a list
of dependencies and a standard place to put libraries
(at present they're split between ../libraries and /usr/share/java
depending on whether they're present in the Ubuntu Lucid repos.
Clearly it shouldn't be tied to the OS setup like this --
they should all be ../libraries).
