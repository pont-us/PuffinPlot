A bit terse and I wasn't able to clarify with JMG, but I assume 
he just wants the sample PCA directions (and now, sample Fisher
directions) annotated with the sample name on the site equal
area plot. I have now implemented this, albeit with sample names
always to the right of the data point which results in more
text collisions than necessary. But it's not worth implementing
a smarter algorithm until I know whether there's demand for it,
so for now I'll call it fixed.
