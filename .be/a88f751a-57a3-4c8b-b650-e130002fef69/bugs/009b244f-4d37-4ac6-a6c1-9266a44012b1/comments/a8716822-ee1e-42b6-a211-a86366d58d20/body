This appears to be caused be PrinterJob.lookUpPrintServices()
returning an empty list on OS X -- see http://stackoverflow.com/q/23362369
for another report, albeit currently without a good solution.
However, it seems that there's no actual need to call 
setPrintService on the job, so I have simply removed both the
lookupPrintServices call and the setPrintService call. Seems to
work fine on both Ubuntu and OS X.
