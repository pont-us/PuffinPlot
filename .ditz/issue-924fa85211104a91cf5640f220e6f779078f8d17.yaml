title: Multiple fits per sample
desc: |-
  JMG writes:
  It would be a great advantage to be able to save and display
  multiple line and GC fits performed on a single sample (and to
  specify which one is included in site mean). Although it does
  seem to be able to associate both a line and GC fit on one sample
  it only records one with the site parameter file.
