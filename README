==Building==

PuffinPlot is developed using NetBeans, but does not require NetBeans for
compilation: Ant is sufficient. For the Ant upload target, which uploads
binaries and archives to Google project hosting, a valid user name and
password must be supplied in a file named build.credentials.properties. The
file build.credentials.example shows the correct format for the credentials
file.

It is possible for large uploads to exceed Ant's available memory. At the
time of writing, this is not a problem, but if it becomes a problem
the solution is to increase the memory allocation pool size using
the ANT_OPTS environment variable, thus:

  ANT_OPTS=-Xmx512m

(or some other suitably large value).

==Bug tracking==

PuffinPlot uses the ditz bug-tracking system; the bug database lives within
the repository itself. Ditz is available from ditz.rubyforge.org .
