title: Introduce a field export interface
desc: |-
  At present, several classes such as FisherValues use what is
  in effect an implicit interface to export their fields when they
  need to be saved to a file: toStrings(), getHeaders(), and
  getEmptyFields(). These should be codified into an official interface.
