title: First data point has NaN for demag level in some cases
desc: |-
  Consider the following crafted file:
  
  depth   demag   dec     inc     int
  1       0       45      45      3
  1       1       45      45      2
  1       2       45      45      1
  
  Import it using the tabular file importer with 3-axis AF demag.
  The demag. of the first point comes up as NaN, which means that
  it isn't plotted on the on-screen display, and is plotted in a
  ludicrous place on the exported graphics files.

    If 3-axis demag is chosen when importing, but only the X-axis
    demag level is tied to a column, a zero demag level comes out as
    NaN. I've now fixed this in Datum.getTreatmentLevel(), and added
    a comment to explain how such incomplete data is handled.
