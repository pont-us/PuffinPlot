title: Check canvas / screen / printer resolutions OK
desc: |-
  Currently everything is plotted without magnification or reduction
  on screen and scaled to paper size for print. But it looks as though
  insufficient resolution on the canvas itself is producing aliasing
  artifacts on the printouts -- e.g. slightly offset point fills on 
  OS X, and slightly jagged confidence ellipses on equal-area plots.
  Now that scaling is resolution-independent, it would be easy to 
  maintain a very high resolution on the canvas and scale it down by
  (say) 10 for plotting on the screen. (When zooming is implemented,
  the zoom percentage would simply be scaled so that 100% was in fact
  10%.)
