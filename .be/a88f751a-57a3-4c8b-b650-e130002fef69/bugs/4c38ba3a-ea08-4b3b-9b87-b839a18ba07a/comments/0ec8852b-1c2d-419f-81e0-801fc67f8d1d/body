This bug was introduced during the fixing of #266 -- PP was guessing
Continuous if there was a Position field, even if there was also
a Sample ID field. I have now modified the logic to guess as follows:
Depth field -> continuous
No Depth field, no Sample ID, but Position field present -> continuous
All other cases -> discrete
Of course this only takes effect when the measurement type is not
explicitly specified. Ultimately the user should probably be queried
in these cases, as I'm not sure that any heuristic will be 100%
reliable.
