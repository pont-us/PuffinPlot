title: Correct plot margins
desc: |-
  Most of the plots plot slightly outside their margins (mainly
  axis labels and suchlike). They should have their own internal margins
  to make sure that the plot as a whole stays inside its official
  bounding box.

    Done. Only demag and zplot needed fixing. Note that this was a 
    fairly quick-and-dirty solution, hardcoding the thickness of the
    extra "furniture". This may fail if changes are ever made to the
    axis labels or suchlike, but such occurrences should be rare.
