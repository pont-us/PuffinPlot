title: Add support for AMS import from non-Agico files
desc: "Currently, Suite contains importAmsFromDelimitedFile and\n\
  importAmsFromAsc, but only the latter is actually tied to \n\
  the user interface. For anyone not using the Agico software,\n\
  this would mean that the only way to import AMS data would be\n\
  to mock-up an Agico ASC file (ugh). I should re-add UI support \n\
  for the \xE2\x80\x98simple\xE2\x80\x99 AMS import. The method supports both raw\n\
  tensors and principal axes directions, but I should probably\n\
  check them both before exposing it to the UI, since it hasn't\n\
  been extensively tested."
