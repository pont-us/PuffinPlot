title: Manual grouping of samples into sites
desc: |-
  We can't rely on datasets always following OPRF conventions.
  Instead, the current heuristic should be used to set a mutable field,
  which can be overridden by the user. UI could be as simple as: select
  a bunch of samples, hit a button, enter a site name.
