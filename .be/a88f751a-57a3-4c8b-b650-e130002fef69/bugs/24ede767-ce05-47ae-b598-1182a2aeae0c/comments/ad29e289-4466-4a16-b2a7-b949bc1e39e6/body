There's no perfect fix for this -- the conversion factor to
S.I. can't be inferred from the data file. I've added a feature to
let the user rescale the magnetic susceptibility data by a 
specified value, which is probably the best that can be done.
(Actually, if there's AMS data, that might be used to derive a scaling
factor -- I will open this as a feature request.)
