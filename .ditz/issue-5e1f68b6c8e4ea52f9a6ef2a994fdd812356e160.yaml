title: User preference for SQUID orientation
desc: |-
  Currently PP uses an imperfect heuristic to work out whether
  the SQUIDs are in their old or new orientations. We should be more
  up-front about this to avoid invisible errors. Add a user preference.
  Needs a little thought now that saving is implemented, since the
  SQUID flipping is done on load. Time to expand the file format beyond
  the 2G template, perhaps?
