Yes, "fisher on sample" is of doubtful utility and definitely not
commonly used enough to justify the screen space for a button.
On-screen buttons are now "select all", "PCA", and "clear", which 
are probably the most used functions. In most cases people will 
probably use the hotkeys anyway, but there's nothing else to put in
that screen space for now.
