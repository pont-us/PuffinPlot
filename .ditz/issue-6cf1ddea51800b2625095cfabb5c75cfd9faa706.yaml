title: Point selection duplication should have a copy/paste interface
desc: |-
  Currently copying a point selection is a single-step process --
  select a set of samples, and use "copy point selection" to transfer
  the current selection to all of them. It's clearly quicker than copy/paste,
  but less intuitive since the copy/paste paradigm is *very* well-
  entrenched. Christian couldn't figure it out by himself, and he's one
  of PuffinPlot's more assiduous users, so this should clearly be changed
  before PuffinPlot gets a wider release.
