title: Remove per-sample Fisher statistics
desc: |-
  I don't think there's a reasonable use for this facility --
  PCA is entirely sufficient. The slim probability of anyone needing
  it is outweighed by confusion to people who don't need it, and
  by the maintenance overhead of the (admittedly slight) extra code.
