title: Try to make all text editable in SVG exports
desc: |-
  Exported SVG files (both Batik and FreeHEP) have some text
  (the data table and title) as text, and the rest as glyph shapes.
  Both for editability and file size, it would be nice to have all
  text as text. The fact that some of it works OK should make the
  problem easier to track down.

    It seems that TextLayout is the culprit: it uses a GlyphVector
    to display the text. I think I can get round this by using 
    Graphics2D.drawString(AttributedCharacterIterator).

    Fixed by replacing usages of TextLayout.draw with
    Graphics2D.drawString(AttributedCharacterIterator), as
    suggested in comment.
