title: Colour-code points by intensity on equal-area plot
desc: |-
  Christian suggested this in passing, as a quick way of seeing
  which points are more significant without having to follow the lines
  around. Might be a silly idea. Definitely needs to be switch-off-
  able. But easy to implement so worth considering.
