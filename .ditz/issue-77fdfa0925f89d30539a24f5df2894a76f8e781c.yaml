title: Host PuffinPlot publicly
desc: |-
  I should have the main PuffinPlot repository hosted publicly 
  somewhere -- possibly also the bugs if I can get them out of Ditz
  somehow. java.net currently looks like the best option: Mercurial
  support and good integration with NetBeans, apparently.

    Google Code might be preferable to java.net -- no specific 
    NetBeans integration, but apparently fewer hoops to jump through
    to create a project.
