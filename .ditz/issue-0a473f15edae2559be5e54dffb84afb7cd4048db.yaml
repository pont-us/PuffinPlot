title: Multiple graph layouts
desc: |-
  Not every study uses the same layout. It should be easy to
  switch between different layouts -- including which graphs are
  displayed/hidden.

    PuffinPlot can now export and import settings to XML files,
    which provides the requested functionality. But perhaps there
    should be a neater, more specialized interface specifically 
    for switching between plot layouts -- so rather than closing this
    I'm going to defer it to a later release.
