title: Selectable units for data import
desc: |-
  Currently most imported data fields are expected to be in whatever
  units PuffinPlot uses internally -- which means Tesla for AF
  demagnetization fields, and A/m for sample remanences. These units need
  to be selectable by the user during importing, to allow (for example)
  demagnetization fields in mT and remanences in Gauss. Reported by
  Terence Day.
