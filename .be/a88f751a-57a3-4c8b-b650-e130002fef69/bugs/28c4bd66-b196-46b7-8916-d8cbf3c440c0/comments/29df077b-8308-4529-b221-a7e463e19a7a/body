I think the manual's wrong about relationship between current
and selected samples in discrete suites -- current is always
first sample of selection, outline box does not show current and
doesn't show at all in GTK+ LnF. I think the behaviour's OK
(for now at least) so just update the documentation. Also check
that long core current/selection is correctly documented.
