    Now partially implemented. Realized during implementation that
    MS values can simply be folded into the (inferred) corresponding
    remanence Datum objects, since a 2G MS line contains no valid
    fields except for the sample name and MS reading (I think). This
    should simplify a lot of things.
    
    A couple of rough edges (autoscaling; not showing MS axis when
    there's no data) remain.
