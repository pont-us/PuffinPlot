title: Implement conversion to SI units.
desc: |-
  The magnetometer reports everything (I think) in cgs, and currently
  PP plots it as such. It would be useful to be able to convert values
  to SI on the fly and plot them with the appropriate labels.

    Nearly done; just need to check what order of magnitude our
    magnetic susceptibility units are.
