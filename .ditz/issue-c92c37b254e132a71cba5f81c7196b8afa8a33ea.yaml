title: Sensible units for intensity values
desc: |-
  Any way to change the way intensity values are displayed. I have
  corrected intensity values in my composite dotDAT file to S.I.
  thus my mag intensity is now displayed as 3540000. Is it possible
  to have a flexible abbreviation rather than being stuck with
  x10-7. It will make life a bit more manageable when trying to
  think ones way through magnetic intensity. Or maybe we could have
  a self correcting feature? i.e. change a drop down box from emu
  to Am. WOW... [from Christian]
