    Yes, "fisher on sample" is of doubtful utility and definitely not
    commonly used enough to justify the screen space for a button.
    On-screen buttons are now "select all", "PCA", and "clear", which 
    are probably the most used functions. In most cases people will 
    probably use the hotkeys anyway, but there's nothing else to put in
    that screen space for now.
