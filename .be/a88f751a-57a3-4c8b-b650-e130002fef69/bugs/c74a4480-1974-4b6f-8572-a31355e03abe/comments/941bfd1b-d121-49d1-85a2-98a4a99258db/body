The following from Adrian Muxworthy:

Just looking at the "Fisher by site". It does not seem to update properly,
e.g., if the user selects points for PCA for a site, then calculates the
Fisher site mean, it produces the fisher site mean in the site table.
However, if the user wishes to go back and revise their PCA choices, the
Fisher site mean does not update to include the new picks, it seems to
continue with the old ones, even if cleared, re-picked and saved. Perhaps a
quick investigation might resolve this.

a) Fisher by site. Just tested on my Mac using the native mac program; it
seems to work fine. The issue arose on my phd student's windows 7 machine
using puffin plot. On refreshing the "fisher by site" by pressing the
option in the calculations menu, it did not update properly. Leaving the
old fisher by site calculation in the table. The figures etc are all
updated, but that is from a different process I guess.

So far have attempted (and failed) to reproduce using PP 1.02 on:
Windows 7 / Java 8
Windows 7 / Java 7
Windows XP / Java 6
