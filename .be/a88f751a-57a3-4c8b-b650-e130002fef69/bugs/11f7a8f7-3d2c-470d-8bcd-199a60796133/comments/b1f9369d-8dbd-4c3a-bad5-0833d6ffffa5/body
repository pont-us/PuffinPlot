On Mac printouts, the fills for filled points are slightly offset
up and to the left. Examination of the file shows that it's off by
exactly half a PDF unit in each direction. Looks as though this is a
Mac Java bug; should check on Java 6 if I can find a 64-bit Intel
machine. Haven't thought hard about workarounds yet (shifting the fill
to compensate is the obvious but nasty one!) -- in worst case, could
output to PDF via a third-party library like Big Faceless, iText,
or Batik.
