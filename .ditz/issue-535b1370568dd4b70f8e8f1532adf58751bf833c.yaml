title: Fisher analysis for demagnetization data
desc: |-
  Add the ability to calculate Fisher statistics on the directions
  of individual demagnetization steps. Seems odd but has apparently
  been spotted in the literature (awaiting refs from Fabio). This is,
  of course, the very feature that was *removed* for bug
  92d5a588d100232ba50153691028daa186cece86 , after I had concluded 
  that nobody would ever need it.
