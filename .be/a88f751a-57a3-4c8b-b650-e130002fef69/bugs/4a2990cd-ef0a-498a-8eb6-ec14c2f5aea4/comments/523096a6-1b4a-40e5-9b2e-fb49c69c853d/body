With Batik now bundled, size is less of a concern for JavaHelp,
and there is a full HTML manual produced using htlatex. The only 
remaining thing is the work of actually integrating the JavaHelp
classes, producing the JavaHelp files from the HTML, bundling
them into the jar, and persuading JavaHelp to load them. JavaHelp
seems to be fairly old, seldom used, and with limited documentation,
so I'd estimate this at maybe 8-16 hours of work.
