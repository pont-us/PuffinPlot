  A cunning trick to teach the puffin plot would be a 'find mid
  point' on intensity plots.  This would be great for NRM and ARM
  plots. There are scripts out there that will do this for you. I
  have not yet put in the effort to learn how they work but have
  grand plans.

    Probably straightoforward, but need to discuss with Christian to
    get an exact definition for `midpoint', a rationale for doing it,
    and references for the algorithm.
