title: Improve vector export
desc: |-
  At the moment we have SVG export via Batik, and PDF export via
  printing if the OS has a PDF printer driver. It would be good to
  have built-in PDF export (so e.g. Windows users don't have to 
  install a PDF printer driver, and so we get consistent output
  across platforms). The two main options for PDF seem to be iText
  and FreeHEP. FreeHEP also includes SVG (and several other) export
  formats, so if it works well, it could potentially also replace
  Batik.
