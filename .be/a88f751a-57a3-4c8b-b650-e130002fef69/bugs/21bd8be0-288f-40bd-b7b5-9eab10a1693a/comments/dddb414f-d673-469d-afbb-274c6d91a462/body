IIRC I'm only using JAMA to calculate eigenvectors for PCA
analysis. If so it might be worth coding the calculation in
PuffinPlot itself and dropping JAMA, which accounts for almost 10%
of PuffinPlot's source code (although of course in the binary it's
dwarfed by Batik and FreeHEP). Note that the calculation should
be simplified by the fact that we know the matrix to be symmetric.
DAIE does it in an Excel spreadsheet which (with all due respect
to Leo's ingenuity) implies it's not *too* hairy.
