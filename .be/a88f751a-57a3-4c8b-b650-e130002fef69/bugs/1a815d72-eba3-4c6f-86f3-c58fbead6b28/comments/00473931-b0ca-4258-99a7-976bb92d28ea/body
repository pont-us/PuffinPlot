Empty-slot correction needs to be re-implemented so it happens on
loading rather than on-the-fly -- it just gets too complicated
otherwise, and there are few use cases where you'd actually want
to toggle it on and off (basically, 1. testing and 2. err, that's
it). In any case it's unlikely to be widely used so I'm taking
it out of the 1.0 release.
