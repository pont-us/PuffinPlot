title: Make SampleDataPanel updating more efficient
desc: |-
  At present, SampleDataPanel destroys and recreates all its components
  on every update, even if it's just an update to a different sample
  within a Suite. Check whether this is taking significant time, and
  if so, implement separate sample-update and suite-update functions,
  with sample-update just updating the contents of the pre-existing 
  components.
