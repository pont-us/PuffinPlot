`Fisher by site' calculation currently assumes that site code is
the first two characters, and groups PCA values accordingly. Claudio
prefixes his sample names with a suite code, so whole sample name
looks like AB0101.1 rather than 0101.1 -- thus Puffin assumes that 
everything is in one site!

This could be easily fixed by using all but the last four characters as
the site code, rather than the first two characters.
