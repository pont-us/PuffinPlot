A few of the classes in puffinplot.data make reference to PuffinApp.
This is conceptually messy, and (more pragmatically) requires the
GUI to be instantiated even for script-driven manipulation of data
structures. It should be possible to load, manipulate, and save
data from the exposed APIs without having to instantiate a 
PuffinApp first.
