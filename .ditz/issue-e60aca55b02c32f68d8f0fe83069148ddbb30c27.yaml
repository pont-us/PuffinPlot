title: Incorrect PCA line lengths
desc: |-
  If PuffinPlot is started with no saved preferences, PCA fit
  lines are shown at the "Full" setting. However, the Preferences
  window shows the "Long" setting. Once the setting has been changed,
  the actual appearance corresponds to the setting in all cases.

    Defaults were differently set in ZPlot and PrefsWindow; fixed now.
    The fact that the default has to be set identically in two places
    is something of a meta-bug, and I have filed it for future attention
    in ticket #234.
