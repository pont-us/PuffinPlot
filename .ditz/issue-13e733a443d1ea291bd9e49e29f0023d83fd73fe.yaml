title: Rewrite Preferences system
desc: |-
  Over the years, the Preferences architecture has accreted into
  a bit of a mess. This is a meta-bug for various things which could
  be solved by a rewrite. Sub-bugs I have found relating to
  Preferences:
  
  54: Save window position on exit
  57: Tidy up preferences architecture
  130: Move most preferences to Suite?
  201: General API for plot options
  
  There is also: the necessity of duplicating default settings in the
  preferences window and the actual class that uses the preference,
  with mismatches leading to bugs like #233; and the fact that many
  preferences use the same string to represent the programmatically
  parsed setting and the representation displayed to the user. The
  latter is due to a lazy implementation of
  PrefsWindow.makeLabelledPrefComboBox and would cause trouble for
  internationalization among other things.
