title: Rethink site/suite calculations a little
desc: |-
  Suite (formation) direction a little confusing at present --
  I think it's displayed on the suite equal-area plot and (maybe)
  saved in the suite data, but there's no menu item to calculate
  it from site directions -- we've just got one that calculates a suite
  direction from the individual sample directions. I should make
  this all a bit more coherent.
