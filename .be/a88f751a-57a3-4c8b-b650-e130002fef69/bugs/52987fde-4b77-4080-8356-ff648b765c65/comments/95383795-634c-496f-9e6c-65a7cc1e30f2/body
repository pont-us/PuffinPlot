Suite (formation) direction a little confusing at present --
I think it's displayed on the suite equal-area plot and (maybe)
saved in the suite data, but there's no menu item to calculate
it from site directions -- we've just got one that calculates a suite
direction from the individual sample directions. I should make
this all a bit more coherent.
