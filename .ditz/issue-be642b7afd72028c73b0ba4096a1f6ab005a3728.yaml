title: Problems with post-processing exported vector files
desc: "Anonymous reviewer writes:\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98The authors point out that this program is capable of producing\n\
  publication-quality figures with little fuss. I would say this is marginally\n\
  true, especially for the PCA \"blue line\" fit on the Z-plots. While this is\n\
  interesting and useful during the analysis process (and could be useful as an\n\
  element in a published figure)- I would wish to decrease the length of the\n\
  line and clean-up the various plots. I attempted to do this using both the\n\
  PDF and the SVG files, using Illustrator (CS 5.5). The SVG file did not work\n\
  well at all. The PDF opened in Illustrator- put the manner in which the\n\
  graphical elements were defined and grouped- with a multitude of clipping\n\
  masks- made editing and cleaning up the figure very difficult- more difficult\n\
  than similar plots produced by the other software packages we use. Making\n\
  specific recommendations to make these figures more useful is beyond my\n\
  ability- so I am sorry for just pointing out a problem without having a\n\
  specific recommendation for its solution.\xE2\x80\x99\n\n\
  A bit tricky, this one. In particular, \xE2\x80\x98The SVG file did not work well\n\
  at all\xE2\x80\x99 is too vague to be dealt with very specifically, especially\n\
  since I don't have access to Illustrator CS 5.5. Possibly the best\n\
  I can do on this is to add another SVG export option, using the \n\
  FreeHEP libraries, and hope that this one works better. It might be\n\
  as well to have the two options anyway, since you never know what\n\
  people will want to do with the SVGs, and two export libraries increases\n\
  the chance of compatibility with whatever the files are being \n\
  fettled with.\n\n\
  Similar comments go for the PDF export. The criticism is a little more\n\
  specific here, but since PDF export is handled by a third-party library\n\
  I can't directly do much about it. Again, adding another option to\n\
  export via FreeHEP might be the best I can do -- and better documentation\n\
  of course.\n\n\
  I will also test the exported files with as many vector editors as\n\
  I can get my hands on, to see if I can replicate the problems which\n\
  Illustrator seems to have. Very hard to fix reliably without contact\n\
  with the user, though.\n\n\
  Finally, this makes me wonder if it would be feasible to incorporate\n\
  \xE2\x80\x98native\xE2\x80\x99 SVG/PDF export into PuffinPlot -- possibly not as insane\n\
  as it sounds -- I will open a new ticket for it."
