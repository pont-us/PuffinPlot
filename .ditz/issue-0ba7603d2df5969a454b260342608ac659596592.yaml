title: Configurable PCA fit line
desc: |-
  I could partially address Reveiwer 2's problem with post-editing
  of PCA fit lines by adding a configuration option: something like
  "long/short/none", where "short" is truncated roughly to the fitted
  points rather than to the entire plot area.

    I may as well add a colour choose while I'm about it.
