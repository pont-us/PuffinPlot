CO 1. Is it possible ion the save calculations section to save the points
CO: you have selected for the PCA. eg. 100-350Â°C It is a good thing to
have in a file so that you see the evolution of unblocking temps or
coercivity. MDF will tell you a similar thing but it would still be
useful to have this data because it keep you a bit honest about which
points you have picked.

PL: Hmm, neat idea. Would you be wanting an exhaustive list of the points
(along the lines of "100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350") or
just the range ("100-350")? If the latter, there's some ambiguity, since
you haven't necessarily selected *all* the points in that range (indeed,
you might only have selected 100 and 350).
