Previously I tried to keep all preferences in PuffinPrefs, and it
was a pain to keep them in sync with the user controls. Now PuffinPrefs
asks classes to save their own preferences (e.g. GraphDisplay's plot
sizes). But there are still vestigial uglinesses like PuffinPrefs's
copy of the correction value.

Check that everything in PuffinPrefs should be there; if not, move or
eliminate it.
