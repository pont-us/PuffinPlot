This is not worth fixing at present. The KentParams triplets appear
in only a few places in the code; they are implemented as immutable
lists, so unlikely to get into funny states; and it's unlikely that
PuffinPlot's AMS capabilities will be developed at all in the 
foreseeable future. Making this change would risk introducing bugs,
and produce no tangible benefits. Closing as wontfix.
