title: Make points interactive in site EA plot
desc: |-
  Request from Christian, who wants to be able to tweak GC fits
  directly from the site EA plot. Need to think a little about exact
  interaction mechanism though. Certainly could implement 
  click-to-remove but then how do you re-add? Or maybe a toggle to
  show all points in the site EA plot, colour-coded according to
  whether they're used for the GC fit, click to toggle their 
  inclusion. Hmm, maybe trickier than I thought.
