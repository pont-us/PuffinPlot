At present, ‘export suite calculations’ just seems to give
a single mean. If a site contains sites of both polarities,
it should give both normal and reversed means. Actually on
closer inspection it's worse: we're just exporting the fisher
mean of all the individual PCAs. This is certainly worth doing,
but we definitely also need meta-means of the site means.
(ISTR Opdyke & Channell has some discussion of which of the 
techniques is superior but it's as well to do both and let
the user choose.)
