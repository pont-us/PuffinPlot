Perhaps the easiest way to tie this one up for now -- without
losing any current functionality -- would be to implement another
SuiteCalcs object, but for all the loaded suites. The calculations
could be saved as for the other types of calculation, which would
probably be more useful than the current modal dialog implementation.
I would open ‘implement proper reversals test’ as a new bug
for a future version.
