title: Separate data manipulation from GUI
desc: |-
  A few of the classes in puffinplot.data make reference to PuffinApp.
  This is conceptually messy, and (more pragmatically) requires the
  GUI to be instantiated even for script-driven manipulation of data
  structures. It should be possible to load, manipulate, and save
  data from the exposed APIs without having to instantiate a 
  PuffinApp first.
