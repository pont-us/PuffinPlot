title: Configurable PCA fit line
desc: |-
  I could partially address Reveiwer 2's problem with post-editing
  of PCA fit lines by adding a configuration option: something like
  "long/short/none", where "short" is truncated roughly to the fitted
  points rather than to the entire plot area.

  - I may as well add a colour chooser while I'm about it.

    First stage done: I've created an explicit clipping routine 
    (none in the Java libraries, alas) so we're no longer relying
    on setClip to truncate the lines (which caused problems with 
    vector export anyway).

    Added another line length, bringing the tally to four
    (Full, Long, Short, None) and documented the settings in the
    manual.
