title: Better UI for empty slot correction
desc: |-
  Current semantics are more complicated than necessary. Easiest would
  probably be to remove the "unset empty slot" action entirely -- identical
  effect can be achieved by disabling the empty slot correction.

    Empty-slot correction needs to be re-implemented so it happens on
    loading rather than on-the-fly -- it just gets too complicated
    otherwise, and there are few use cases where you'd actually want
    to toggle it on and off (basically, 1. testing and 2. err, that's
    it). In any case it's unlikely to be widely used so I'm taking
    it out of the 1.0 release.
