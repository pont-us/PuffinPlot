title: Separate text elements from plots
desc: |-
  Currently there are three textual components on the graph display:
  1. Sample name and correction (anchored to top left)
  2. PCA results (anchored to Z-plot)
  3. Fisher results (anchored to equal area plot)
  
  These should all be independently positionable like other plots.
  (This will require variable-width margins since the current margin
  sizes won't let them get small enough).

    Implemented as specified. Margin sizes are now determined by an
    overrideable method in the Plot class.
