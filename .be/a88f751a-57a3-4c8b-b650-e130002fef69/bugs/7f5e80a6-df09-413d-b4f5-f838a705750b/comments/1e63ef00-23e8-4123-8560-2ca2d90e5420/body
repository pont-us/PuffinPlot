Actually explicit representation would be overkill; Puffin's internal
representation just needs to be well-defined. In a sense it is already
well-defined as "whatever comes out of the 2G software" but it would
be neater to convert these to standard SI units upon loading. As soon
as Puffin grows the ability to import other data formats, using the
fairly arbitrary 2G units (CGS, implicit orders of magnitude, etc.)
for internal representation becomes a little ridiculous.
