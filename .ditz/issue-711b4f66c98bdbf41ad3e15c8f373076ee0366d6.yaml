title: "Add a \xE2\x80\x98plot close-up\xE2\x80\x99 window"
desc: |-
  It can be handy to get a close-up view of a single plot
  without editing the main layout. This feature could replace the
  current stand-alone site and suite windows. It would simply
  open up a window containing a single selected plot -- a duplicate
  of one of the ones in the main area, but automatically resized to
  fit the window.
