title: Puffin crashes on an ARM file
desc: |-
  Of course it's not meant to handle ARM (yet) but it's certainly
  not meant to crash. The file in question is DVDP-11-17.13.DAT (or, I 
  think, any of the others in the same suite).

    Apparent cause: file contains "Degauss Z" (as opposed to "Degauss Z - 
    ARM axial") treatment type which PP doesn't recognize.
