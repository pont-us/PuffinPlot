Another advantage with defining an internal vector graphics API:
I can include things which Graphics2D doesn't support. At present
I am thinking specifically of grouping graphics elements, which
is very handy for post-processing of SVG files (it would be nice
to get one group per plot) but can't AFAIK be represented in
Graphics2D -- it's irrelevant for drawing to the screen, after all.
