title: Rethink site/suite calculations a little
desc: |-
  Suite (formation) direction a little confusing at present --
  I think it's displayed on the suite equal-area plot and (maybe)
  saved in the suite data, but there's no menu item to calculate
  it from site directions -- we've just got one that calculates a suite
  direction from the individual sample directions. I should make
  this all a bit more coherent.

    Some progress with this as part of #186 -- means are now
    calculated and stored using both sample PCA directions and site means.
    Calculation and saving to CSV is now comprehensive and rational.
    Still need to do something about the plot, however -- probably just
    tie it into the newly expanded suite means, and plot either
    the overall site mean or the two hemispherical means if they're
    available. Fall back to the sample-level mean if there aren't
    any site means. Ideally it would be configurable but that will have
    to wait.
