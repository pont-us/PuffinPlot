= PuffinPlot development notes

PuffinPlot is a program for palaeomagnetic data plotting and analysis,
written by Pontus Lurcock. This readme describes the requirements for
building PuffinPlot and its documentation from source, and is intended
for developers rather than users. Users are advised to download the
latest PuffinPlot release from the project website at
http://talvi.net/puffinplot/ and consult the included user manual.

== Building PuffinPlot

PuffinPlot is structured as a Maven project, and can be built by running
`mvn package` in the root directory. Most dependencies will be automatically
downloaded and installed by Maven, but the manual is written in LaTeX and
therefore requires manual installation of some additional tools and libraries.

PuffinPlot is currently developed mainly in
https://netbeans.apache.org/[Apache Netbeans], and the `nbactions.xml` file
provides some NetBeans-specific Maven actions, but development is not tied
to any specific IDE. In particular, PuffinPlot's Swing GUI does not make use of
the NetBeans Matisse GUI designer.

PuffinPlot can optionally make use of Jython; the required Jython package can be
dynamically downloaded, installed, and used by PuffinPlot at runtime, but it is
not a build-time dependency.

=== Dependencies: user manual

The manual is typeset as PDF and HTML using LaTeX. Some PDF and PNG
figures for the manual are automatically generated from SVG sources
using Inkscape when the manual is built.

On most Debian-based operating systems, all the TeX dependencies should
be installable with the command

----
sudo apt install tex4ht texlive-fonts-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended inkscape
----

The following programs and packages are required to build the manual. For each
program or package name, the name of the Debian package containing it is
also given.
