Some progress with this as part of #186 -- means are now
calculated and stored using both sample PCA directions and site means.
Calculation and saving to CSV is now comprehensive and rational.
Still need to do something about the plot, however -- probably just
tie it into the newly expanded suite means, and plot either
the overall site mean or the two hemispherical means if they're
available. Fall back to the sample-level mean if there aren't
any site means. Ideally it would be configurable but that will have
to wait.
