title: Fisher analysis for demagnetization data
desc: |-
  Add the ability to calculate Fisher statistics on the directions
  of individual demagnetization steps. Seems odd but has apparently
  been spotted in the literature (awaiting refs from Fabio). This is,
  of course, the very feature that was *removed* for bug
  92d5a588d100232ba50153691028daa186cece86 , after I had concluded 
  that nobody would ever need it.

    Fisher means are now handled almost as fully as PCA directions.
    They are displayed in plots and used in site- and suite-level means,
    and documented in the manual. However, they are not currently saved
    as part of a PuffinPlot file. This would be a little awkward to
    implement and unless there is urgent demand it would be more
    reasonable to leave it until I implement support for multiple fits
    per sample (issues #247 and #259).
